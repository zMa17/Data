<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_04">&lt;hpage&gt;The bugs of your land, I have watched them, climbing towards their absolution without the flicker of a thought to what it means.&lt;page&gt;Aye. But isn&#8217;t it always such for those snared to serve your higher caste?&lt;page&gt;Our mortal mob did once act some defiance, unawares maybe, but successful in part, goaded towards it by Weavers&#8217; will&#8217;n all.&lt;hpage&gt;You speak of the Citadel? Its former function has failed, but I can still sense its purpose, some. It is church and cage both.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Devised by your ancestors that monstrosity, and their wicked, clever minds. A system, or a web they&#8217;d likely call it, a way to keep their mother sealed in slumber, and themselves free to lavish in their false rule.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_DELIVERY">&lt;hpage&gt;Maker, I bring a delivery from Bellhart below, lacquer for your long work.&lt;page&gt;Ahh. Know you distort the order of things, Old One. It is a rare want of your caste to serve us mortal bugs.&lt;hpage&gt;I am not my kin, Maker. I have seen enough pain born of their dominion. As much as I may, I choose to stand apart.&lt;page&gt;If your blood allows it so... And my thanks still for the lacquer. Pharloom&#8217;s fresh faces will welcome its sheen.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT1_ACT3">Until cavern&#8217;s collapse, the masks must be made! </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_REPEAT_ACT3">Enough talk, Old One. My contract remains. I&#8217;ll work till caverns&#8217; collapse.&lt;hpage&gt;Very well, Maker. If it is within my power to do so, I shall see your lands saved.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_MEET">Ahh. Old One. Your kind should know it&#8217;s rude to expose me such. Unmasked, the task becomes heavy. &lt;hpage&gt;I had the desire to hear you lucid, Maker, though you may protest.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Well its no great shock to have you visit. I&#8217;ve felt the stirrings of our monarch, even all the way out here, the tremors of her kin brought close.&lt;page&gt;You&#8217;re planning a confrontation with her then? The one atop? Our great, frayed god?&lt;hpage&gt;Our meeting seems inevitable, though first I seek the strength to ensure a favourable outcome.&lt;page&gt;Ha! As I&#8217;d have guessed! Your ancient kind aren&#8217;t told to abide one another peaceably.&lt;page&gt;Well, assuming you prevail, I&#8217;ll ask only that my labour may continue. No matter the state of these lands, you should well know the necessity of my service.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_PREVIOUSLY_MET_ACT3">Back again, Old One? The effects of your... altercation with the pale mother... those are plainly sensed. The fate for these caverns feels grim.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;ll take it things have taken a turn more complicated? Or was this the aftermath anticipated all along?&lt;hpage&gt;In our meeting, a mortal blow was dealt, but the monarch&#8217;s desperate death throes now threaten to take this whole kingdom with her.&lt;page&gt;Ha! I&#8217;m not surprised! It&#8217;s always the way, aye? Your ancient kind, vying for dominion, and us mortal bugs squashed unseen underneath.&lt;hpage&gt;It was freedom I sought, Maker. Naive perhaps, but this is not the fate I wished to come.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT1">All deserve a face. A chance to be! Until I wither, for the faceless I shall provide. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT2_ACT3">To exist, to die, a face is needed. It is the essential thing.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_DELIVERY">&lt;hpage&gt;Maker, I bring a delivery from Bellhart below, lacquer for your long work. &lt;page&gt;Good! Good! To seal. To protect. May Pharloom&#8217;s fresh faces gleam bright.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_POST">Take reward for service made, visitor! Gift for you, to spend or treasure!</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_MEET">A visitor! Grand you are. But you have already a mask. Already a face. It is for those without that I must carve. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT3">To work! To work! The masks must be carved.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_PEAK">Did you treat with the creature upon the summit?&lt;page&gt;Your legged ancestors once found her company compelling, enough to build their chambers and their calling device at the height of this perilous peak.&lt;hpage&gt;I have paid my respects, and been granted her favour. Her down now fills my cloak, and does much to ward against the frost of these heights.&lt;page&gt;To pass something so precious... That&#8217;s a mighty gift you&#8217;ve been given. Seems she&#8217;s thrown her lot in with you.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;d not have guessed her so opposed to our threaded monarch, but then she too must have sensed the wretched state of things, and the harsher change to come. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_MEET_ACT3">Ahh. Old One. Your kind should know it&#8217;s rude to expose me such. Unmasked, the task becomes heavy. &lt;hpage&gt;I had the desire to hear you lucid, Maker, though you may protest.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Well its no great shock to have you visit. I&#8217;ve felt, and heard, the effects of your... altercation with the pale mother... The fate for these caverns seems grim.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;ll take it things have taken a turn more complicated? Or was this the aftermath anticipated all along?&lt;hpage&gt;In our meeting, a mortal blow was dealt, but the monarch&#8217;s desperate death throes now threaten to take this whole kingdom with her.&lt;page&gt;Ha! I&#8217;m not surprised! It&#8217;s always the way, aye? Your ancient kind, vying for dominion, and us mortal bugs squashed unseen underneath.&lt;hpage&gt;It was freedom I sought, Maker, for myself and for you mortal few. Naive perhaps, but this is not the fate I wished to come.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_MEET_ACT3">Late! Late you are! And already a mask. Already a face. It is for those without that I must carve. </entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_POST_UNMASK">Have some small reward for your troubles, Old One. It&#8217;s no small thing to deliver that sloshing stuff safe, &#8216;specially all the way up here.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_RELATIONSHIP">A fine face, yours. Not of my work. Not of this kingdom&#8217;s craft. Not now at least.&lt;page&gt;But the deeper form. Distant relationship. Some form of Pharloom and our old, legged, stewards. &lt;page&gt;Now! To work. To work! The masks are needed.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_TALK_03">&lt;hpage&gt;You have the sight, Maker. Tell me what you see in me?&lt;page&gt;Your mask... It reads clear enough, Old One. Watcher, hunter, monarch even, though you may reject that station.&lt;page&gt;A complex visage, perhaps, yet still to my sight it looks unresolved.&lt;hpage&gt;If you see a transitional state, it is one I have accepted. My mask has remained defined through lifetimes uncounted.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Rigid I&#8217;m sure, but your kind rarely develop evenly, and the lifetime of bugs are poor measure for one like you.&lt;page&gt;Could be there&#8217;s more growth awaiting you yet...</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT3_ACT3">Our world cries its end! But the masks must still be carved.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_UNMASK_REPEAT">Enough talk, Old One. Mine is a calling that scant allows rest.&lt;hpage&gt;Very well, Maker. I shall take my leave.</entry>
<entry name="MASK_MAKER_REPEAT2">To exist, a face is needed. It is the essential thing.</entry>
