<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_OFFER">Oho? You linger here still? Perhaps, like myself, you have been bewitched by the Plasmium&#8217;s beautiful glow?&lt;page&gt;Then join me, you must! A new assistant is needed. Together we shall unlock the secrets of this wondrous substance!</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_REFILL_ACCEPT">There, you are replete with wonderful Plasmium once more! You can begin injecting it at once. Now, off with you!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_REOFFER">Assistant... You will help, yes? The buds have ripened... The Plasmium harvest can begin...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_REFUSE">Leave your fear behind... Cast it off like an old shell. Give me what I need...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_REPEAT">Bring the Pure Plasmium. It must be tested... ingested.&lt;page&gt;Ready the Needle Phial to full charge... Strike deep the ripened buds. Return that precious liquid life to me... Assistant.</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_ACCEPT">Excellent! With two bugs at the task, the rate of discovery shall greatly increase!&lt;page&gt;Now! Before he up and vanished, my previous assistant seeded the warrens below with Plasmium buds.&lt;page&gt;The buds should be ripening as we speak and the nectar within must be extracted before they reach maturity.&lt;page&gt;With the right tool in claw, collecting the nectar is an easy process. I&#8217;ll even lend you my own Needle Phial for the job.&lt;page&gt;Once you locate a bud, simply charge the Phial until readied, then release its needle into a bud&#8217;s core. Do it right, and it&#8217;ll suck out the nectar in one clean pop!&lt;page&gt;Return them to me when you&#8217;ve retrieved the necessary samples. With the right nectar, and the right testing, Plasmium can reveal even more of its wondrous properties!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_CANCOMPLETE">Assistant, that odour... aahhh.... you have the Plasmified Blood...</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_REPEAT">Keep using the Plasmium Phial, and enjoy all the wonderful effects it has on your body. Once your Plasmium reserve runs dry, visit me again.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;ll charge a few rosaries for refills, but you can be confident that every bead goes towards our vital studies!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_REFILL_REFUSE">Do you fear the Plasmium, even now? Ahhh... Assistant... open your mind to the possibilities...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_REPEAT">Assistant... What we might become... together.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_ACCEPT">Ahhhh. Yes... Assistant. So loyal... Take the Needle Phial... find the buds below. They are ripe...&lt;page&gt;Charge the Phial to full strength... Pierce them deep... Extract that Pure Plasmium.&lt;page&gt;This shell shall become what you need it to be... Plasmium can cure all.</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST_REPEAT">Assistant! You&#8217;re still dallying about here? I&#8217;ve an eager need for pure Plasmium, fresh from the bud.&lt;page&gt;Just one fully charged stab of my Needle Phial straight into a ripe bud! You&#8217;ll suck the Plasmium right up!&lt;page&gt;Now, pop down into those worm warrens and extract it for me! What could possibly be more important?</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_OFFER_ZANGO">&lt;hpage&gt;I am curious about the equipment you have here, and the blue liquid contained within. What study consumes you?&lt;page&gt;Ahh yes! So this miraculous substance intrigues you too! A wonder beyond wonders, miracle made material!&lt;page&gt;Plasmium! A naturally occuring elixir with no equal! It heals wounds and strengthens shells! I suspect it can even defy death itself!&lt;hpage&gt;Plasmium, you call it? I have encountered its like before, or else a substance of remarkable similarity...&lt;page&gt;Highly unlikely! The grey and barren soil of the mainland could never produce something as singular as this, and that is undisputable fact!&lt;page&gt;Plasmium was discovered by my master at the farthest edge of Pharloom, hidden deep in salt-stricken waters. I brought it to these caves under her direction, to study how it flourishes in a foreign place.&lt;page&gt;Perhaps, like myself, you have been bewitched by the Plasmium&#8217;s beautiful glow? Would you assent then, to assisting me in my studies?</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_REOFFER">Plasmium is a marvel of nature! And a new assistant is sorely needed. Together, let us unlock its secrets!</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_MEET_ZANGO">Oho? A new face! Not here to bother, I hope? I&#8217;ve critical studies underway in these twisting tunnels and can afford no distractions!&lt;page&gt;You haven&#8217;t met Zango, my assistant, by chance? An indolent sort? Short, slovenly, rather unreliable-seeming?&lt;hpage&gt;In a dark cave below here, I encountered a shell not dissimilar from your own. I suspect your assistant may have met an unfortunate end.&lt;page&gt;Ah ha! That careless buffoon. No surprises then. That lump never shone with the talent for true discovery.&lt;page&gt;Now! To my work I must return! With my assistant so rudely dying on me I&#8217;ve tasks enough for two bugs.&lt;page&gt;Unless you have further interest in my precious Plasmium, kindly leave me in peace!</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_REFILL_REFUSE">Oh? Those who hesitate learn nothing, you know! The wondrous bright glow of Plasmium makes all things clear!</entry>
<entry name="LIFEBLOOD_GLAND_MSG">Plasmium Gland</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_OFFER">Assistant... to learn more of Plasmium&#8217;s wonders... I know what we must do... &lt;page&gt;The bugs below... who have imbibed the substance... and evolved... their bodies are full with Plasmified Blood...&lt;page&gt;You must use the Needle Phial and extract this precious nectar... only by scrutinising it... can we attain higher knowledge...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_COMPLETE_1">&lt;hpage&gt;I have retrieved the Pure Plasmium, as requested. Know that, in your current state, I feel some reservation passing it to you.&lt;hpage&gt;This path your research takes... The final result may not be pleasant.&lt;page&gt;Pure Plasmium? No... Assistant... You must not doubt... It is precious. Perfect. It was needed... You have done well. As always...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_OFFER_PRE">These lands have taken the Plasmium well... the soil has drunk it deep, and the creatures bloom so beautifully... have you seen them?&lt;hpage&gt;The effect of your Plasmium on the beasts here is all too evident. Great change has been inflicted upon them.&lt;hpage&gt;There is an echo also of other infections I have witnessed. I wonder at the meaning of it all... or if I am perhaps imagining similarities where there are none.&lt;page&gt;Assistant, ahhh... you grow more inquisitive... We both seek deeper insight...&lt;page&gt;Could we... peer deeper inside somehow...? Let us think on it...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_REFUSE">Ahhhh... Assistant.... greed was ever your greatest failing. Do not guard your discoveries so jealously...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_REPEAT_DONE">For you... dear assistant... drink deep my liquid life...</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST_COMPLETE_2">Since you have proven yourself a capable assistant, take this delightful implement of my own invention, a Plasmium Phial.&lt;page&gt;With it, you can inject precious Plasmium straight into your body. Almost painlessly!&lt;hpage&gt;Your tool certainly looks sharp enough to pierce my shell, sir, but why should I want to do so?&lt;page&gt;Because filling your body with Plasmium is so beneficial! It protects you from harm! And it feels so exquisitely good!&lt;page&gt;My assistant and I have been injecting Plasmium into the local flora and fauna since we arrived. No ill effects have been observed, and so we can conclude that the process is utterly, completely safe.&lt;page&gt;Keep using the Plasmium Phial, and enjoy all the wonderful effects it has on your body. If you ever run out of Plasmium, visit me again.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;ll charge a few rosaries for refills, but you can be confident that every bead goes towards our vital studies!</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_QUEST_COMPLETE_1">Ahh, and exactly the required amount! A satisfactory effort, assistant!&lt;page&gt;With this pure Plasmium extract, I may finally come to understand this wondrous substance.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_REPEAT">Ready the Needle Phial... find the plasmified bugs below...&lt;page&gt;Charge the Phial to full strength... Pierce them deep... Extract the Plasmified Blood...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_OFFER">Assistant... You will help, yes? The buds have ripened... The Plasmium harvest can begin...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_REOFFER">The bugs below who have imbibed the substance and evolved... their bodies are filled with Plasmified Blood...&lt;page&gt;You must use the Needle Phial and extract this precious nectar... only by scrutinising it... can we attain higher knowledge...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_COMPLETE_1">&lt;hpage&gt;Take it sir, though what insight it will grant you I cannot say.&lt;page&gt;Have faith, dear assistant... After all this I understand... the greatest knowledge comes only from faith... faith in Plasmium.&lt;page&gt;This blood you have collected... sparkles... I see it! A glorious form... a glorious future, shimmering back at us...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_DECLINE">You decline, Assistant? You cannot. The buds... The harvest. It must occur... For the source, and your saving...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_DECLINE">What fear arrests you...? This must be done... or we will never learn the deeper truth... Never become what is needed...</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_DECLINE">You would refuse?! There is much work to be done, and it is all so achingly slow when I have no aid!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_ACCEPT">Ahhhh. Yes... Assistant. So loyal... Take the Needle Phial... find the plasmified bugs below...&lt;page&gt;Charge the Phial to full strength... Pierce them deep... Extract their Plasmified Blood.&lt;page&gt;Once we have it... we can peer deeper... learn more... enlighten ourselves fully...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_MEET">Ohhhhh... Assistant? Is that you?... You return at last, my friend?&lt;hpage&gt;Sir, you are in a disturbing state. This substance sprouts from within your shell. Time will see it consume you entirely. Would you seek aid?&lt;page&gt;No... No... Assistant... you are confused. A wonderful thing, we become. The Plasmium, our great research... We have progressed.&lt;page&gt;The research must continue. Soon... I shall become a source. </entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_REFILL_OFFER">Assistant! Have you come to refill your reserve of Plasmium?</entry>
<entry name="LIFEBLOOD_REFILL_PROMPT">Refill Plasmium Reserve?</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_MEET">Oho? A new face! Not here to bother, I hope?

<entry name="BS_SIT_REFILL_ACCEPT">There... more. Let it seep deep into your shell... do not begrudge the pain...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_CANCOMPLETE">The Pure Plasmium... you have it. I can... smell it on you.</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST2_COMPLETE_2">Through consumption of the blood... we shall at last attain enlightenment...&lt;page&gt;For your reward... take the gland from within my shell... my gift to you.&lt;page&gt;I have no more need of it... and it shall grant you... unending reserves of Plasmium...&lt;page&gt;Yes... Plasmium. Pure... beautiful... Plasmium...</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_CANCOMPLETE">Assistant! How goes your work? Have you extracted a sufficient amount of Plasmium for me?</entry>
<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_ACCEPT_ZANGO">Excellent! With two bugs at the task, the rate of discovery shall greatly increase!&lt;page&gt;Now! Before he went and died, my previous assistant seeded the warrens below with Plasmium buds.&lt;page&gt;The buds should be ripening as we speak and the nectar within must be extracted before they reach maturity.&lt;page&gt;With the right tool in claw, collecting the nectar is an easy process.

<entry name="BLUE_SCIENTIST_REFUSE">Are you so enchanted by the Plasmium that you will not part with it? You are more like that dolt Zango than I first thought!&lt;page&gt;Its enlightenings are beyond your meagre mind! Give me the phial, assistant, or the deeper secrets of this substance will never be revealed!</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_REFILL_OFFER">Aahhh... and you have been using your Plasmium... good. Let me replenish your reserve...</entry>
<entry name="BS_SIT_QUEST1_COMPLETE_2">Now. Share the discovery... Take this Plasmium Phial... Plunge it deep. Feel its vigour soak your shell...&lt;page&gt;If more is needed... If the Plasmium runs dry... return. Visit me again... That you may live, long... my loyal assistant.</entry>
