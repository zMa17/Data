<entry name="ARCHITECT_AFTER_SHRINE">&lt;hpage&gt;Master, I have communed with the shrine above. Your learnings are unique, techniques born of cogwork hearts. Their mastery will require some commitment on my part.&lt;page&gt;Bug-Red, you are the first organic shell to fuse our memories. S-s-s-such behaviour, my line would have believed improbable-impossible. &lt;page&gt;Still, your broad arsenal did suggest strong affinity with the m-m-m-mechanical craft, enough to allow access to our thought-store.&lt;hpage&gt;Yours is an impressive skill, Master. I am grateful for the insight.</entry>
<entry name="CONFESSIONAL_START_BROKEN">Speak... ... confession...</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_WEAVER_SHOOT">A fine artefact you carry there, Bug-Red. That broken tool, it is Weaver-make? &lt;hpage&gt;I believe so, Master. A relic of their old workshop, lost in fetid caves beyond this Citadel.&lt;hpage&gt;The parts suggest a weapon of thread, one I would attempt to repair myself, had I endless time.&lt;page&gt;An Architect&#8217;s work owes much to the art of the f-f-first children. They set expert standard for the tools and talents of Pharloom eternal.&lt;page&gt;If you desire-demand, I can remake the tool, though my own mind-directives may produce u-u-u-nique result.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_SILKSHOT">An intricate implement of Pharloom&#8217;s first children. I can restore-repair the w-w-weapon, though it will bear some trace of my identity-idiom.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_TALK_REPEAT">Bug-Red. Do you ask-need our service? We shall create, as is our d-d-directive. To serve, for Pharloom eternal.</entry>
<entry name="CONFESSIONAL_START">Speak now. Thy confession will be heard.</entry>
<entry name="LARGE_COG_WORK_SONG">Hrrr. Hrrrrrrr. Them sounds you make. Of holy sort. When me hear such sounds, me remember of home. Me remember of be little.&lt;page&gt;It make it painful hard to work, such remembers. Me must keep working. Please, friend. Do not make them sounds no more.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_WILL_LEAVE">My s-s-service to you, Bug-Red... As it concludes I must speak-confess. Long now I have felt my rotors slow their s-s-spin. My limbs lift weak. An ending is felt, coming, sudden-certain...welcome.&lt;hpage&gt;Whatever fading you feel has not shown in your craft, Master. You have provided tools of immaculate make.&lt;hpage&gt;What will follow if you pass? Would another take your place? &lt;page&gt;One cannot. The skill to construct an Architect... That was taken by t-t-time. I am the last-final. The core remains to sustain the song, but no more Architects to tend-toil or build anew. &lt;page&gt;S-s-strange... &#8216;For Pharloom eternal,&#8217; states the d-d-directive-cage. But how can eternity sustain without an Architect to serve? This seems e-e-error. An end? An error... welcome?</entry>
<entry name="LARGE_COG_WORK_MEET">Hrr. Hrrrrr. Who is there? Me can not... can not clear see....&lt;hpage&gt;At ease, large one. I am no danger to you.&lt;page&gt;Hrrrrr? Hrrrr! Me see you now! So clean, so lively... Surely you did come from above! Me time has come at last! Me work is done. You come to bring me up! Up, up! Hrrr!&lt;hpage&gt;You mistake me. I am no resident of the Citadel. I am a stranger here, though no foe to you.&lt;page&gt;Hrrr. Hrrrrrrrrr. S-stranger? Me grave mistaken. Forgive me, thems above, for me unworthy hope! Of course me work is not done! Harder, harder! Me must work harder!</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_TALK_REPEAT_ACT3">Bug-Red. Do you ask-need our services, even n-now? Our duty is l-l-long, but we shall create for you, if you require it...</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_KEY">If Bug-Red could prove their aptitude with our implements, and others like, I would offer my key, to grant access to the chapel-store above. </entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_MELODY">&lt;hpage&gt;Master, I seek a melody held by your line, one part of a sequence and key to ascending above the Citadel. Can you teach it to me?&lt;page&gt;Our melody? I r-r-recall! Yes! There was melody, once, but its sound... that I possess no longer...&lt;page&gt;T-t-t-too long I have worked. From my mind-vault, the imprint has f-f-faded. With many things it is like this... remembrance, dimmed...&lt;page&gt;But you m-m-may hear it, still. At the height of our core,  there is means-s-s-system, near complete... Constructs old-built to sound our song. They need only be set to functional form. </entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_MELODY_RETURN">Are you still to c-c-climb our grand core, Bug-Red? Within you may marvel at the work of Architects, my own, and all those passed b-b-before.&lt;hpage&gt;My path takes me in many directions, Master, but in due course, I will ascend the core and claim the melody atop it.</entry>
<entry name="LARGE_COG_WORK_CITADEL">&lt;hpage&gt;May I ask what you know of the Citadel above you, sir? You go to much effort to reach it.&lt;page&gt;Hrrrrrrrr! The Citadel! Most miracle of a place, bright and holy! Fresh water for all, much as can drink! Air so clean, can see the great rooves above! &lt;page&gt;When me thinks of Citadel above, me works hardest of all! Hrrrrrrrrr!</entry>
<entry name="CONFESSIONAL_END">You have confessed a sin most grave and must by works cleanse yourself.&lt;page&gt;Return to your task and work off-cycle, neither eating nor supping until new-cycle begins.&lt;page&gt;By the grace of Pharloom eternal may you never tire. Toil, and be forgiven.</entry>
<entry name="LARGE_COG_WORK_TOGETHER">Hrr. Hrrrrr! Good, me friend, good! When us works together, is more holy! Is more work done!&lt;page&gt;Together, lets us work raw hard &#8216;til thems above see how worthy us is!</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_MELODY_GAINED">&lt;page&gt;What&#8217;s this, Bug-Red? Even down here, I d-d-did detect its working... Have you climbed our c-c-core, and woken the voices of my l-l-line?&lt;hpage&gt;I have maker. Clearly it was a climb never intended for regular bugs, and fair fortune that the skills gifted within your lands allowed my ascent.&lt;hpage&gt;The melody, and the voices... both are fine things heard and witnessed. Even in this fading moment, their artistry shines through.&lt;page&gt;Impressive-industrious... eternal... You have seen a glimpse, Bug-Red, of us-s-s, how once we were. The minds of Architects inspired. What majesty we did create...</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_MEET_ACT3">&lt;hpage&gt;Master, you seem the lone maker left in this ruined Citadel. Are you my enemy? The other constructs of this place did object aggressively to my presence. &lt;page&gt;Bug-Red? I am a m-m-maker. Yes. Enemy. No. I am an Architect. Only an Architect. To build-automate, it is our nature-directive-c-c-c-cage.&lt;page&gt;Why are you here, Bug-Red? The time is late. Do you seek-need service of an Architect? You are weave-type, yes, a first child. Rare-e-e-extinct? Or not it does so seem.&lt;hpage&gt;You see it true, Master. I bear the lineage of weaver, along with other strands, equally strange.&lt;page&gt;Then on your r-r-request, Bug-Red, as directive demands, for Pharloom&#8217;s first children, a-a-a-and our kingdom-eternal, I shall c-c-craft.</entry>

<entry name="LARGE_COG_WORK_WORK">Hrrrrrrr. The harder me work, the sooner it come. Thems above, them watch us, always. Work hard, work hard, and us will go up. Hrrrr.&lt;hpage&gt;Sir, I fear you are long forgotten by your masters. Should you not rest? The burden this toil is placing on your shell is plain to see.&lt;page&gt;Hrrrrr? Hrrrrrr. You speaks strange. Me can not rest. Us works, and Citadel breathes, and thems above do sing, and all is right.&lt;page&gt;And when us works enough, thems see it... Hrrr.... thems see it, and us gets us holy reward...</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_TOOL_KIT">Tools of my craft. They could be used to improve your own. Make harder, sharper.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_SCUTTLEBRACE">A flexible shell-prosthetic. It would enhance a weave-type&#8217;s flexibility, allowing evasive options. </entry>
<entry name="CONFESSIONAL_END_BROKEN">You... ... sin... ... cleanse....&lt;page&gt;Return... ... work... ... begins....&lt;page&gt;... Pharloom... ... never... ... forgiven.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_COGWORK_SAW">You have affinity for such radial blades? I can b-b-build upon the idea-knowledge. Make them retract. Make them force-store.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_KEY_REQUIRE">Acquire {0} more tools to prove aptitude.</entry>
<entry name="LARGE_COG_WORK_REPEAT">Hrrrrrr. Me can not say much more, friend. Thems is watching. Us must keep working. </entry>
<entry name="AUTO_SHRINE_DOOR_INSPECT">A locked gate bearing the symbol of an Architect.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_SHARDPOUCH">Raw materials, for creation. Carry them with you always, that y-y-you may be prepared.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_KEY_REQUIRE_SINGLE">Acquire 1 more tool to prove aptitude.</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_COG_HEART">Those pieces of a h-h-heart-core you carry upon you, how did you acquire-recover an artefact so rare?&lt;hpage&gt;They were scattered about the Citadel, each seemingly laid with purpose. Someone wished the thing dismantled, but showed respect enough to see it stored safe.&lt;page&gt;That heart is an inspired form, conceived by the first of my line for a knight of cog and blade.&lt;page&gt;In it, I see my predecessor&#8217;s talent, immense, now lost-forgotten. I could never create-copy a work s-s-so fine.&lt;hpage&gt;And the knight that once bore the heart? Tell me of them.&lt;page&gt;A gleaming order, cogwork sentinels, so impressive-majestic in function they were charged-b-b-bound to the highest holy duty.&lt;page&gt;Long before the c-c-creation of the core, the sentinels ventured, even beyond these walls, to see all bugs brought-forced safe to serve the Citadel.&lt;page&gt;If the h-h-h-heart were restored within the sentinel&#8217;s shell, would it give thanks for the awakening? Or would it grieve those lands now l-l-lost?&lt;hpage&gt;In time, maker, I may find out...</entry>
<entry name="ARCHITECT_SHOP_DESC_BROLLYSPIKE">This band of metal teeth, sharp and light-fine. It could be woven within your red outer layer? A hidden weapon.</entry>
