<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_REMEET_NO_SHRINES">The Citadel is calling us, sister! We stand so close. We need only the blessing of those bells to see the Grand Gate open.&lt;hpage&gt;I will awaken the bells, pilgrim. With luck, you will not be waiting long.</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_REPEAT_NO_SHRINES">Only the holy bells of the great path shall open the way!&lt;page&gt;We beg you, traveller, see the bells awoken, that we may cross this final threshold.</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_REMEET_GOT_SHRINES">Ahhh... the gate! The bells have awoken! All along the path. Now we need only music, to see them attuned! &lt;hpage&gt;I have recently learnt the art of producing song by strumming Silk, though I confess it is a skill deserving of more practice.&lt;page&gt;Oh! Ohh! Have no doubt, sister! Play sincerely. Any music is sweet enough! Play for us and surely the bells will resound! Play, and we will sing!</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_REMEET_SHRINES">Ahhh... the Grand Gate! The bells have awoken! &lt;page&gt;We beg you, sister. Play or sing and we shall follow. Call out to the bells of the path and see the gate open!</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_REPEAT_SHRINES">We beg you, sister. Delay no further! Play for us. Call out to the bells of the path and see the Grand Gate open!</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_MEET">The gate... the gate! O, the Grand Gate to the Citadel stands before us!&lt;page&gt;We are so close! O mighty ones beyond the gate, we beg you! Open the way and let we poor, insignificant little pilgrims crawl into the light...&lt;hpage&gt;I see no gatekeepers to heed your plea, pilgrim, though I too seek entry to the Citadel. Have you heard of a means to open this gateway?&lt;page&gt;Ahh... Weapons blunt it not. No holes for keys. &#8216;Tis the bells, they say! The holy bells upon the path that open the way!</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_NO_SHRINES">&lt;hpage&gt;I have passed several such bells, pilgrim. I know how to see them woken. Tell me what you know of their locations and I shall seek those that still remain silent.&lt;page&gt;Sister? This is a mighty service you willingly perform! What a marvellous gift you would grant to your fellows. &lt;page&gt;Eagerly, I shall tell you of the shrines and their locations, as we have heard them spoken...</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_ALT">The gate... the gate! O, the Grand Gate to the Citadel stands before us!&lt;page&gt;We are so close! O mighty ones beyond the gate, we beg you! Open the way and let we poor, insignificant little pilgrims crawl into the light...&lt;hpage&gt;I see no gatekeepers to heed your plea, pilgrim, though I too would benefit from its opening. Have you heard of a means to pass through?&lt;page&gt;Ahh... Weapons blunt it not. No holes for keys. &#8216;Tis the bells, they say! The holy bells upon the path that open the way!</entry>
<entry name="GATE_PILGRIM_MEET_SHRINES">&lt;hpage&gt;On my journey up, I passed many large bells housed in old shrines. Each I have struck awake, yet still this gate stays closed. What other task must be done to see us pass beyond?&lt;page&gt;The bells are rung? Then this sacred threshold may now be crossed, for the final task is simple! Only music, played fair and true. Music shall attune the bells, and see the gate descend.&lt;page&gt;It must be you to lead us, sister! You, who brought this blessing! Play or sing and we shall follow.</entry>
