<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_DECLINE_QUEST1">Ah... I understand, stranger. I presume too much of one who is not a flea.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;ve heard the settlement below us is setting up a wishwall. Perhaps I&#8217;ll send Grishkin down to hang up our wish...&lt;page&gt;</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_EMPTY">Bug not flea, my learnings, all have been scratched to your maps. Can give no more.&lt;page&gt;Leave now! Seek and save lost fleas, for a caravan full and whole!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_INFO_HUNTER">Have you met her yet? Our burly new companion, Vog! Fresh returned from a long time spent tracking.&lt;hpage&gt;We have met, Fleamaster. It gladdens me that so strong a flea exists as her.&lt;hpage&gt;Yours was a caravan sorely lacking for protection, and I am too bound by my own tasks to provide it for you.&lt;page&gt;Why, we would never impose so! And now, no matter! Her scent may be strong, and her taste for brew bottomless, but her skill is sharp.&lt;page&gt;If predators draw close, her talents will provide much confidence to our caravan.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET_NOMAP_ACT3">You remain, bug not flea? Would you seek service of me, ehh? Mine is knowledge much, the places of the lost little ones, heard and smelt across the caves.&lt;page&gt;You could help find! And bring! For all to come together now that times turn dark...&lt;page&gt;But no map you hold! If learnings are wanted, a map must be owned. Until then, we have no trade to make.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ACT3">Our travels have end, and now soon the world will also have end! At such bitter of times, brew with friends is most sweet.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_INTRO">&lt;hpage&gt;Greetings again, sir flea. I see you were able to unite safely with this caravan.&lt;page&gt;Oh yes! All thanks to you! Dear, sweet you! Heh heh!&lt;page&gt;The Fleamaster, that old bore, tells me to call you Miss Hornet. But such a prickly name ill befits such a delicate beauty! Shall I call you something prettier, like &#8216;Nectarsweet&#8217;, my dear?&lt;hpage&gt;You shall not. Address me by my name or not at all.&lt;page&gt;Gradak! Of course. Of course! Heh heh. And now, I shall let you in on my little secret. My carriage doubles as a soothing spa, you see. It&#8217;s most ingenious.&lt;page&gt;The water inside is piping hot, and purer than a psalm! Heh heh! I&#8217;d gladly let you soak inside, for a modest fee!</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_FIRST">Dear one, how shameful for the world to end while poor Kratt still has so much living left in him!&lt;page&gt;But how sweet of you to join me here! Will you play the Flea Bounce game, that I may appreciate the beauty of your agile form while I await my doom?&lt;page&gt;To play is simple. Leap up and keep bouncing on the fleas who fly past for as long as you are able!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_REPEAT_GREYMOOR">Strange beasts prowl these grey lands. I hear them roar and shriek outside camp. Is best to stay inside and make quiet.</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_CHOICE">Compete in Flea Dodge?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_FLEATOPIA">At longest last, have our flea roamings ended! Every sandy grain and stinky squelchy maggot was worth to endure, to claim such a home!&lt;page&gt;Is time for rest and celebrate, and none have earned such more than you, Miss Hornet! Raise your flask and drink most heartily with us!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_REPEAT">We will camp here in these grey lands until more fleas find their way to the caravan. Please lend your aid to any of our fellows you find lost out on the roads!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ACCEPT_QUEST_OUTRO">&lt;hpage&gt;I am travelling these lands for my own reasons, Fleamaster. However, if I happen upon any fleas on my travels, I will aid them as best I can.&lt;page&gt;Oh, oh I could ask for nothing more! They must all be hiding or stuck in dangerous places, but if you rouse them they are sure to find their way here to us.&lt;page&gt;May the kingdom bless your travels and keep you safe, stranger! You are welcome to rest here with us whenever the roads bring you back!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_MEET_TRAVELED">The journey here was long, but we didn&#8217;t lose a single flea! I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s good luck to bring a guest along when travelling, so we must have you to thank!&lt;page&gt;I trust the trip was agreeable for you. A pleasure perhaps? Nestled in with our dear little ones...&lt;hpage&gt;They certainly make for energetic travel companions. I&#8217;ve not often had opportunity to socialise with such spirited sorts.&lt;page&gt;Splendid! And now, you must go and see Grishkin, sitting there by the bubbling cauldron. After long travel, we drink to revive our spirits!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_BREW_FULL">Miss Hornet, your bottle is full of Flea Brew. You know what such means! You must have drink! Har har!&lt;page&gt;When you have finish drinking, return and we will fill flask again! I&#8217;m is always brewing!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT">My fellows give much worry for the other fleas, but I&#8217;m not give at all. They will find their way to us, and if not, who keep count of them anyway? Har har!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_REWARD">Ahh, and before the road steals you away from us again, allow me to offer you a humble gift!&lt;page&gt;One of the little ones found a pale artefact while digging about in the sands. A spiny, cold sort of thing.&lt;page&gt;I see no use in it for we fleas, so of course we are all too pleased, eager even, to bestow it upon our dear friend!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_DELIVERY_FLEATOPIA_POST">For your hard efforts and eternal friendship, please accept these meagre rosaries as reward.&lt;page&gt;Think of we fleas when you find chance to trade them!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_TALK_ACT3">Dear one, my lone light amongst the darkness! Will you bathe in Kratt&#8217;s spa-carriage and let the warm waters wash away your worries?</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_ACCEPT_2">Please, my dear, step inside! I will stand guard here while you bathe... Right on this very spot!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_MEET_GREYMOOR">Dodeshna. Want for shelter from the thick, grey air? Is heavy, and wet. I&#8217;m worry for the little flea&#8217;s health in this land.&lt;page&gt;And they make play in the filthy water. I say them stop, but they just laugh and splash on me. They are lack respect!&lt;hpage&gt;Most bugs instinctively obey those with strength and will. Speak with authority, or your commands may go unheeded.&lt;page&gt;Ugh... really, is Fleamaster&#8217;s job to teach the fleas such. I will just have rest here until is time to move on.</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_DECLINE">Away then, bug. Await challenger, shall I.</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_COMPLETED">Vikna! Our little game has ended. But I trust, after a short rest, you will play with us again?</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_BOARD_TITLE_JUGGLE">Juggle</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ACCEPT_QUEST1">Ahh! Do I understand you rightly, stranger? You will help gather the lonely fleas to our caravan? Truly?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_FLEATOPIA">Miss Hornet! Our saviour! How dearly we had hoped you would visit.&lt;page&gt;And just look! This beautiful spot you&#8217;ve gifted us, safe apart from the dark and death of the lands beside. A place for fleas to grow smart and strong.&lt;page&gt;Here we shall see our travels end, for in Pharloom there could be no finer place to settle.&lt;hpage&gt;I am glad the location suits, Fleamaster. It is a calming thing to know these many fleas may survive. Most bugs of Pharloom seem destined for far bleaker fates.&lt;page&gt;Indeed! A hopeful future awaits! And only because of yourself and your efforts. To commemorate our arrival, it would be my pleasure to perform a small service for you.&lt;page&gt;I have been learning to sew, and the little fleas have been gathering materials for me. I thought I could add an extra pocket to your tool pouch, to make your travels just a little easier.&lt;page&gt;A trifling favour, much less than you deserve, but still I hope it meets to your satisfaction!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_REFUSE">&lt;hpage&gt;I know not what you plan, Fleamaster, and at this time I cannot participate.&lt;page&gt;Ahhhh. Ahhhhhhh! Wretches, wretches, all of us! How can we begin without you, dear friend?</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_OUTRO_SCENE">Gathered here we are, to honour the grand champion of this very final of all festivals!&lt;page&gt;Now, Miss Hornet! Strike the great effigy with all your might!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA">The little fleas like this place most of all. They are as much happy as I ever hear them!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_INTRO_FULL_EARLY">Oh dear friend, Miss Hornet, look at our marvellous troupe! Their numbers full. Their spirits bright. All thanks to your heroic efforts!</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_CHOICE">Compete in Flea Bounce?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_JUDGE_TRAVELED">Another journey complete! And a new, high spot for our rest, upon the doorstep of that mighty Citadel, no less!&lt;hpage&gt;It is fortunate that all of your companions survived the trek, Fleamaster. The howling rise beside, and the tangled wood before it, have both claimed the lives of countless bugs.&lt;page&gt;Indeed! A perilous ascent! Maybe it was your company that brought us luck, Miss Hornet? It surely put us fleas at ease to have you and your weapon riding close.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_INTRO_ALT">Oh and look, Miss Hornet, look at how many lost fleas have come! It seems even the last few stragglers are now with us.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_1">Ah! Aha! A native of these fiery lowlands approaches! Have no fear, my friend, we fleas are but humble travellers!&lt;hpage&gt;Well met sir, though like you I am not of these lands. I am merely journeying through.&lt;page&gt;Oh. Oho! A kindred spirit! It&#8217;s good luck for wanderers to meet on an unfamiliar path.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_TALK">Dodeshna, dear one, dodeshna! Heh heh! Have you returned to use Kratt&#8217;s luxurious spa-carriage? I&#8217;ve kept it roastily warm for you...</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_COMPLETED_HIGHSCORE">Vikna! The game is now ended, and the Flea Juggle champion has set an even higher score! Tremble in awe, dear fleas, at the might of our dear Miss Hornet!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_INCOMPLETE_QUEST1">There are many lost and lonely fleas still scattered across this kingdom. If only some more of them joined us, the caravan could continue its journey.&lt;page&gt;You&#8217;ll find the little dears in all sorts of strange places, for they love to peek and pry and play, but if you rouse them they are sure to find their way here!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_FLEATOPIA_REPEAT_ACT3">Those great rumbles from beneath, they are have sound similar to giant beast. Such beast is much sorrowful though, I am think.&lt;page&gt;Fleas and monsters alike have their troubles...</entry>
<entry name="HORNET_FLEA_LAKE_FOUND">&lt;hpage&gt;The Fleamaster and his caravan sought for caves offering space and safety. This calm lake and shore may prove suitable.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_READYTOLEAVE">Oh, Miss Hornet! Wonder at how large our caravan has grown! So bold and boisterous! This gilded chamber can barely contain us all!&lt;page&gt;The many fleas are itching to journey once more, to find a space to stretch their wings. But from here, as their leader, I am hesitant to order us so swiftly away.&lt;page&gt;These heights hold too much danger to set forth without a safe goal held clear in mind.&lt;page&gt;What of you, Miss Hornet? Your tasks carry you throughout this kingdom. Have you ever encountered a place appropriate?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_GENERIC">We will camp here a time before moving onward. These moments of safety and calm must be treasured, rare as they are.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_INTRO">Oh my dear friend, Miss Hornet, look now at how many of the lost fleas have come! It seems even the last few stragglers are now with us.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_2">And now that we have met, know that I am Fleamaster Mooshka, leader of this caravan!&lt;page&gt;Our own journey has barely begun, but you are most welcome to tarry here a while, stranger. Where ways are dark and winding, good bugs must stay close together!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_JUDGE">The bellowing sandy land was full of much danger. We was almost lost poor Varga to hungry worms as we travel up!&lt;page&gt;Sadly, he is finding way here after all. Har! Is only jest. Grishkin and Varga is great friends, just like all fleas is being.</entry>
<entry name="BREW_REFILL_PROMPT">Refill Flea Brew?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_ALL_FLEAS_FOUND">You have brought them all, bug not flea. My work is done! No more searching needed. Ours is a caravan full!&lt;page&gt;Now my duty must change. To watch. To protect. This new task I am looking much to liking.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_RETURN">Is warm here, you agree? Is very... what is say, cosy?&lt;page&gt;The Fleamaster though, is always want to move on. We will be drag away somewhere much worse soon, I think.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_DECLINE">Oh... what a shame. Heh heh! I think you&#8217;d find the waters inside delectably soothing, if you&#8217;d only reconsider!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_DELIVERY_FLEATOPIA">&lt;hpage&gt;Fleamaster, I bring a delivery, supplies from the couriers of Bellhart to aid your settlement.&lt;page&gt;Such dedication you continue to show us, Miss Hornet!&lt;page&gt;While we may seem safe out here at range from danger, we cannot go far to forage, and the many fleas need much nurture!&lt;page&gt;Food and provisions, such as you bring, are crucial in these desperate times.</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_INTRO_REPEAT">This trial is Flea Dodge. Stay upon platforms, avoid attacks. Longer stay gives bigger score.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET">Dodeshna, dodeshna! I am saying, welcome to our caravan, stranger!&lt;page&gt;You are a very funny, very strange flea, isn&#8217;t it? No fur at all, and your wings fall off!&lt;page&gt;Har, har har har! Is just jest, of course. Us fleas famous for giving jokes!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_RETURN">Some beasts here, I see them eat through the bony ground. Is very smart! Bone is everywhere much abundant! If only I had such stomach, har har!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_FESTIVAL">Drink to full, Miss Hornet! Why waste? Be merry with us fleas before it all ends!</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_COMPLETED_HIGHSCORE">Vikna. The trial has ended and you have bested your old score. Rishkiz, champion!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_OFFER_QUEST1_REPEAT">Normally I would never burden a visitor with the caravan&#8217;s worries. But! Isn&#8217;t it the custom of this kingdom to share your deepest wishes with strangers?&lt;page&gt;Well, my wish is for the poor lost fleas of these lands to find their way to our caravan! Stranger, could you not help us?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_CANLEAVE">&lt;hpage&gt;Fleamaster, if your troupe is still prepared to travel, I have discovered a cave beyond the Citadel, at the edge of some ancient aqueducts. That place may well suit your needs for safety.&lt;hpage&gt;The trek would be long, but once reached you will find a sandy shore, free of predators, beside a wide clear lake. It is as peaceful a place as I&#8217;ve seen throughout these fraught lands.&lt;page&gt;That&#8217;s it! It must be! Our destination has at last been set. Our journey can continue!&lt;page&gt;True friend of fleas you are, Miss Hornet. That place shall welcome us, no doubt. Will you be joining for this new journey?</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_INTIMIDATED_ACT3">My treasured guest... what need have I of rosaries, now that all is ending? Please, use my spa-carriage, free of charge! Dear Kratt is only too happy to provide!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA">So many lost fleas have made it here... Truly, I&#8217;d never dared to hope we could gather such a grand company!&lt;page&gt;But still there may be more out there in this wide world... What a wonder it would be if they too found their way to our fresh paradise!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_WOUNDED_TALK">Auugghhh... the pain! Such fury, over a mistake! Poor little Kratt did not mean to steal a look!&lt;page&gt;This old carriage needs constant care. I was only doing repairs! I had no intent to intrude! And I barely saw a thing!&lt;hpage&gt;Lie no more to me, flea, and be grateful you still live. Know that if you peer again, you will die.&lt;page&gt;Of course! Kratt would never! Let&#8217;s consider the matter forgotten, and you shall forever be my treasured guest!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_BREW">Dodeshna! Miss Hornet, is it? Welcome to our new camp! The travelling is done, and so we drink! &lt;page&gt;Is no better way to revive spirit than to drink the famous Flea Brew! I&#8217;m have just finished a batch, bubbling and warm!&lt;page&gt;You are friend, finder of lost, little fleas, hmm? Here, take bottle of Flea Brew with you! Will keep you warm while you travel.&lt;page&gt;I am always brewing here, so have no fear to drink plenty, and return whenever you are wanting more!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPLE_HUNTER_MEET_COMPLETE_ACT3">You remain, bug not flea? If service is you here seeking, none is left for me to provide. All fleas are here, collected close.&lt;page&gt;Much better it is now for fleas to be together, ready to face whatever end will come.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET_NOMAP">&lt;hpage&gt;Fair greetings again, large flea. Of your many companions, I had little worry you would survive to find this caravan.&lt;hpage&gt;Would you tell me now of the task that saw you so apart from your fellows, and so fearsome in form?&lt;page&gt;Grrr....Mine is to track, by trail and smell and senses sharp. Find our friend fleas, our young most of most, to bring them together and grow them strong.&lt;hpage&gt;If you have sensed the locations of other lost fleas, would you share them with me? I may be able to send them safe to the caravan.&lt;page&gt;The locations! For price they could be shared, but you hold no map to mark! If learnings are wanted, a map must be owned. Until then, we have no trade to make.</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_INTRO_FIRST">Bug. World is ending. Nothing left but to test ourselves.&lt;page&gt;This trial is Flea Dodge. Stay upon the platforms. Avoid attacks. Longer stay gives bigger score.&lt;page&gt;To score most is to become champion. This is only thing left to strive for.</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_INTRO_CHAMP">Bug, you are champion of Flea Dodge, but trial is still open to you. Can you defeat your own score?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_ACT3_MEET">So bug not flea, you return. World is ruined. Final end comes soon, says Fleamaster.&lt;hpage&gt;This land is gravely wounded, but death need not follow. It is now my task to free this kingdom from its dark fall.&lt;page&gt;Grrr... such words are just fancy. Nothing left now, except to protect what little we have.</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_INTRO_REPEAT">Come, you revellers! Try the Flea Juggle game! Keep striking fleas upwards. Keep them airborne for as long as possible!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_CANLEAVE_FIRST">&lt;hpage&gt;I have seen a place, Fleamaster, a cave beyond the Citadel, at the edge of some ancient ducts. That place may well suit your needs for safety.&lt;hpage&gt;The trek would be long, but once reached you will find a sandy shore, free of predators, beside a wide clear lake. It is as peaceful a place as I&#8217;ve seen throughout these fraught lands.&lt;page&gt;That&#8217;s it! It must be! Our destination has been set. Our journey can continue!&lt;page&gt;True friend of fleas you are, Miss Hornet. That place shall welcome us, no doubt. Will you be joining the caravan on this journey?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_ALL_FLEAS_FOUND_ACT3">All are here now, bug not flea. For your seeking, ours is a caravan full.&lt;page&gt;Much better it is now for fleas to be together, ready to face whatever end will come.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SAVED">Ooh, heh heh heh! What a turn, for dear Kratt to be strung up in such a dank little cave!&lt;hpage&gt;Cursed threads stretch throughout this land, set to ensnare the unwary. You seem no worse for it now, at least.&lt;hpage&gt;That metal carriage... It is yours, I assume?&lt;page&gt;Ooh, yes, yes! I&#8217;m setting out to join the nearest flea caravan, aren&#8217;t I? Safety in numbers, yes? I&#8217;ve had more than enough of venturing alone.&lt;page&gt;And you... I trust I will see you there? My carriage hides a special secret I&#8217;d gladly share with you when next we meet! Heh heh!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_COMPLETE_WISHWALL_QUEST1_FULL">And now, with our caravan bursting, we&#8217;ve rested here long enough. We fleas must head higher!&lt;page&gt;Oh, but stranger, how remiss of me! First, please, what shall we call you?&lt;hpage&gt;You may call me Hornet, Fleamaster. Know that I, like you, am glad to see your fellow fleas safe with your caravan. These are dangerous lands to travel alone.&lt;page&gt;Oh, vavenda! That is to say, incredible! What a beautiful thing it is! All of us together.&lt;page&gt;Dear friend... Miss Hornet. Our caravan prepares to depart toward the wide moor high above. Would you travel with us, as our honoured guest?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_PURCHASED">I have marked your map, bug. See the learnings of fleas lost across the lands.&lt;page&gt;If you are as brave as told by fellow fleas, seek them. Save them. For a caravan whole.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ALLRESCUED">You are welcome here always, Miss Hornet, true friend of fleas!&lt;page&gt;Stay as long as you care. Rest and restore. We many fleas do so enjoy your company.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_READYTOLEAVE_NO_LAKE_REPEAT">Dear friend of fleas, please! If ever you come upon a cave both wide and free, return with haste and tell us.&lt;page&gt;The fleas are oh so eager to journey, and I&#8217;m eager to see them to a destination safe!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED_ACT3">&lt;hpage&gt;That is well, Fleamaster. My travels through this land have been far and deep, and yet at almost every reach I met the friendly, inquisitive presence of your kind.&lt;hpage&gt;You fleas have an uncommon desire for adventure which I find admirable, even if it is seldom matched by capability.&lt;hpage&gt;Though I am long accustomed to travelling alone, following your journey, and sharing some part in its progress has been a warm thing.&lt;page&gt;And so happy have you made we fleas! Even as the darkness comes to claim us, we would be honoured to bestow one final gift, a treasure from fleakind&#8217;s glorious past.&lt;page&gt;May it mark you in Pharloom&#8217;s final moment as a friend to us all.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_JUDGE">You are have luck, Miss Hornet, to lack the fur of we fleas. All the blowy sand of that place is getting very stuck inside!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_REPEAT">The beasts here are... much frightful, hm? Scary?&lt;page&gt;But if give them space, they leave alone. You respect beast, beast respect you.</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_INTRO_GAMESCOMPLETE">Grand Champion... bug called Hornet. Will you once again challenge the Flea Dodge trial?</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_GAMESCOMPLETE">Fierce one, my dear Grand Champion! Will you dance and fly with us above the water?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_DELIVERY_FESTIVAL">&lt;hpage&gt;Fleamaster, I bring a delivery, supplies from the couriers of Bellhart to aid your settlement.&lt;page&gt;Ahh, such a kindly gesture adds much warmth to our celebration!&lt;page&gt;These poor little fleas will never grow to roam the world as we have, so let us give them what happiness we can before the end.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_INTRO_MARROW">&lt;hpage&gt;Greetings again, sir flea. I see you were able to unite safely with this caravan.&lt;page&gt;Oh yes! Heh heh. All thanks to you! Dear, sweet you! Pray tell, what does one call such a delicate beauty? Surely yours is a name most sweet and soothing. Are you Fairgrace? Or Nectarsweet?&lt;hpage&gt;I am Hornet, sir. Address me by that name or not at all.&lt;page&gt;Gradak! Of course. Of course. My dear, Hornet! I shall let you in on my little secret. My carriage doubles as a soothing spa, you see. It&#8217;s most ingenious.&lt;page&gt;The water inside is piping hot, and purer than a psalm! Heh heh! I&#8217;d gladly let you soak inside, for a modest fee!</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_ACCEPT">Mamashka. The trial begins. Flea Dodge!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_ALREADYACCEPTED">&lt;hpage&gt;I saw your plea posted at Bellhart, sir flea, and accept your request.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_TALK_1">The dirge I sing is for the end of our old lives...&lt;page&gt;Here at the end of times, our paradise crumbles beneath us. Flea and friend alike, all will soon be consumed...</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_FOUND_FLEAS">Ahh, look! The poor fleas are starting to make their way to us! What a precious thing!&lt;page&gt;We have much to thank you for already! And I hope we will have even more to be thankful for very soon! Please, keep seeking out our lost fellows!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_WILD_MEET_NOCARAVAN">Grrr.. bug, not flea. Why you must bother me? This spot is mine, fair fought and earned.&lt;hpage&gt;I won&#8217;t stay long, madam. Nor would I contest your right to this cave. I only ask what task causes you to perch alone atop these dank ducts?&lt;page&gt;Task? Mine is a work most important, but not for talking of here, where danger waits close. Soon, I depart, to seek fleas, my fellows, and join them.&lt;page&gt;Now... Grrr. You leave me! I go soon to seek other fleas. A flea alone is good, but fleas together is best! Till then, rest I need! Off, bug!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_REOFFER">Dear friend... Miss Hornet! Forgive us, but we beg one more favour from you. Will you accompany us in our final act...?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_ACCEPT_2">It is time for the Festival of the Flea! One last, grand celebration before the black quakes pull us all down into the darkness!&lt;page&gt;Rouse yourself fleas, one last time! Let the games begin!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_LEAVE">Ahhh! Alas. Then we shall pray your own path remains safe.&lt;page&gt;And now, our new home is calling. We venture again!&lt;hpage&gt;Good travels, Fleamaster. May your journey ahead be safe and smooth.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_COMPLETE_QUEST_SKIP_FULL">But stranger! While you&#8217;re with us, you must hear of the miracle that has occurred!&lt;page&gt;See all these fleas gathered to our troupe? It seems so many! An impossible number, yet here they are, safely joined together. Our most cherished wishes answered!&lt;hpage&gt;If you were seeking fleas to join your caravan, I have found and freed many throughout my travels.&lt;page&gt;Oh! Can it be? Then you here are our saviour, our dear fleafriend! For all have made their way right, straight to us!&lt;page&gt;And now, with our caravan full to bursting, we&#8217;ve rested long enough. We fleas must head higher!&lt;page&gt;Oh, but saviour, how remiss of me! First, please tell, what shall we call you?&lt;hpage&gt;You may call me Hornet, Fleamaster. Know that I, like you, am glad to see your fellow fleas safe with your caravan. These are dangerous lands to travel alone.&lt;page&gt;Oh, vavenda! That is to say, incredible! What a beautiful thing it is! All of us together.&lt;page&gt;Dear friend... Miss Hornet. Our caravan prepares to depart toward the wide moor high above. Would you travel with us, as our honoured guest?</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_INTIMIDATED">Welcome back, my fierce one. Dodeshna! Heh heh! I&#8217;m sure your travels have wearied you.&lt;page&gt;Oh no, I wouldn&#8217;t dare take rosaries from such a treasured guest! Please, use my spa-carriage, free of charge! Dear Kratt is only too happy to provide!</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_OUTRO_PRE">Miss Hornet! You have proven yourself the champion at each of our flea games!&lt;page&gt;I am confident now that the grand champion of our festival has emerged. It is none other than yourself, of course!&lt;page&gt;And thusly, must our final ceremony begin. Fleas, prepare yourselves!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_MEET_FESTIVAL">Good friend of fleas is you, Miss Hornet. Now must join and drink much. Be merry before all ends. Brew is made, enough for all!&lt;page&gt;No charge for you if needing more. Why waste when future is final?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_INFO_LECH">A strange flea has joined our troupe. All are welcome, but something about this one sets my fur to raise.&lt;page&gt;His carriage offers a steaming service, but the charge in rosaries is stiff, especially for us fleas who carry few.&lt;page&gt;For the companionship we provide, and the safety of our numbers, surely some discount is deserved?</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_COMPLETED_HIGHSCORE">Vikna! Dear one, you outdo yourself! To beat your previous high score is a marvel indeed!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_WILD_REPEAT">You still here, bug not flea? Is rest I need before I leave for caravan. Not chat. You feel trouble-type. Make my shell tense.&lt;hpage&gt;I shall take my leave, madam. Stay strong on your own journey. May we meet again at the caravan, amongst your fellows.</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_DECLINE">Ah, of course. Perhaps you will be trying one of the other games?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_REPEAT_NOMAP">Grrr... bug not flea. Still wishing for knowings of my work? But you hold no map to mark! Until a map is owned, we have no trade to make.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_ACCEPT">Thank you. Thank you! I&#8217;ll treasure these sweet-smelling rosaries dearly! Now, don&#8217;t be shy. Step inside!</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_COMPLETED_CHAMP">Vikna! My dear one, my dancer, the game has ended and you have proven yourself the champion!&lt;page&gt;None can best your score, you have shamed us all with your fearsome grace! But you will keep playing for me, yes?&lt;page&gt;The end of the world need not be a lonely thing... eheh heh...</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_QUEST1_TRAVEL_ACCEPT">Excellent, excellent! Let us make preparations and be off without delay! Rouse yourself fleas, for the caravan roams once more!</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_REPEAT">My dear, will you play Flea Bounce for me once more? Leap up and bounce on the fleas who fly past for as long as you are able!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_SETH">Say you dodeshna to the new flea sitting there? Is quiet one, but is very good at games!&lt;page&gt;Have no worry for him, Grishkin will look after. Will fill him with brew and meet him to all the other fleas.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_JUDGE">Here we shall remain, for a time, Miss Hornet, and pray that more lost fleas find their way to us.&lt;hpage&gt;What others I encounter, I shall send your way, Fleamaster.</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_POT_TAKE_BREW">Take Flea Brew?</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_BOARD_TITLE_BOUNCE">Bounce</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ALLRESCUED">&lt;hpage&gt;That is well, Fleamaster. My travels through this land have been far and deep, and yet at almost every reach I met the friendly, inquisitive presence of your kind.&lt;hpage&gt;You fleas have an uncommon desire for adventure which I find admirable, even if it is seldom matched by capability.&lt;hpage&gt;Though I am long accustomed to travelling alone, following your journey, and sharing some part in its progress has been a warm thing.&lt;page&gt;Ahh, and so happy too have you made we fleas!&lt;page&gt;I would be honoured to bestow one final gift unto you, miss Hornet, a treasure from fleakind&#8217;s glorious past. May it mark you forever as a friend to us all.</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_ACCEPT_INTIMIDATED">The spa is yours, dear guest! And always open for one so considerate and kindly as yourself... eheh heh...</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SAVED_REPEAT">With luck, my dear, we will meet again when I have joined the flea caravan.&lt;page&gt;My carriage hides a special secret I&#8217;d gladly to share with you when next we meet!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_ACCEPT_1">The pact is made then. Fellows! Steel yourself! It is time, it is time!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_FLEATOPIA_REPEAT">This long lake... Space is much more big here. Finally I have some quiet from the little fleas.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_QUEST1_TRAVEL_DECLINE">Ahh, that is a shame, but I understand. I&#8217;m sure our roads will cross each other soon enough.&lt;page&gt;And now, we must be off! Rouse yourself, fleas. The caravan roams once more!</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_INTRO_GAMESCOMPLETE">The grand ceremony has ended, but still we play! Will you honour us with a display of Flea Juggle, Miss Grand Champion Hornet?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_TRAVEL">Wonderful! Wonderful! The fleas will be overjoyed to share this next journey with our favoured companion! Let us away!</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_ACCEPT">Mamashka! Let our beautiful game begin! Flea Bounce!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_READYTOLEAVE_NO_LAKE">&lt;hpage&gt;Unfortunately not, Fleamaster. I have visited many of this kingdom&#8217;s caves and none would offer the safety and space you require.&lt;hpage&gt;If ever I come upon such a place, I will let you know.</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_BOARD_SPIRIT_NAME">Flealia</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_INTRO_FIRST">How do you like our festival, Miss Hornet? While the world crumbles around us, we will laugh and dance and frolick!&lt;page&gt;Make merry with us, and play some of the games of old!&lt;hpage&gt;My time is slim, Fleamaster. If I am to join your games, know it will be only to hone my skills for the greater trial I must soon face below.&lt;page&gt;Of course! Of course! Joy or learnings! Any reason is fine by us, Miss Hornet!&lt;page&gt;And look here, we have Flea Juggle, where the challenge is to strike fleas upwards and keep them airborne for as long as possible.&lt;page&gt;To have our treasured guest challenge this humble game would be an honour for us, truly!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_WOUNDED_REPEAT">A mistake, treasured guest! Never again! Ohhh. Never again!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET">&lt;hpage&gt;Fair greetings again, large flea. Amongst all of your troupe, I had little doubt you would survive to reach this caravan.&lt;hpage&gt;Would you tell me now of the task that saw you so apart from your fellows, and so fearsome in form?&lt;page&gt;Grrr....Bug not flea! Mine is to track, by trail and smell and senses sharp. Find our friend fleas, our young most of most, to bring them together and grow them strong.&lt;hpage&gt;If you have sensed the locations of other lost fleas, share them with me. I may be able to send them safe to the caravan.&lt;page&gt;My learnings? Not free for you, bug not flea. Rosaries! Give those and I shall say of what I have sensed. Work like mine... much long, and hard. For that, I deserve some riches held.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ACT3">So many lost fleas have made it here... Truly, I&#8217;d never dared to hope we could gather such a grand company.&lt;page&gt;But, oh! The world has grown so dangerous, and there may be more lost fleas out there. I do so hope they can find their way to us!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_REPEAT_FLEATOPIA_ALLRESCUED_ACT3">We fleas are all gathered, but now the world has loudly marked its ending! As great as our numbers grew, it seems our caravan will be the last.&lt;page&gt;There is only one thing left to do... but the preparations require time. If your travels wind their way back to us, dear friend, you yourself are welcome to participate...</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_FLEATOPIA_HUNTER_HINT">Miss Hornet, I must tell, we&#8217;ve seen evidence nearby of a hunter of our tribe, a flea that seeks fleas!&lt;page&gt;As pungent and gruff as their sort often are, they&#8217;re still useful to have around a caravan.&lt;page&gt;A flea of their rare skill, settled among us, could offer defence and more.&lt;page&gt;If you&#8217;re still to be helping grow our town, search them out, up atop the muck choked ducts.</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_POT_INSPECT">A cauldron full of Flea Brew.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPLE_HUNTER_MEET_COMPLETE">&lt;hpage&gt;Fair greetings again, large flea. Of your many companions, I had little worry you would survive safe to find this caravan.&lt;hpage&gt;Would you tell me now of the task that saw you so apart from your fellows, and so fearsome in form?&lt;page&gt;Grrr....Mine was to track, by trail and smell and senses sharp. Find our friend fleas, our young most of most, to bring them together so strong they could grow.&lt;page&gt;A task once important, mine! But not now. All fleas are here, safe. A rare many! Time for toasts, and brew to fill our bellies!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_CANLEAVE">Look here! All these lively fleas flocked to our caravan. Thanks to you and your hunting, our numbers grow grand. Mayhap, in time, we could grow to match even those caravans of our fabled past?&lt;hpage&gt;To see so many safe is a welcome sight, Fleamaster. Their playful cheer suggests you are a fine steward for the swelling troupe.&lt;page&gt;Such kind words, Miss Hornet! How lucky we are to have found a friend so fair!&lt;page&gt;But now, we must away! These moors have been our host long enough. It is time to climb and hoist towards drier caves!&lt;page&gt;Good friend to fleas, would you join us on this next journey? </entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_COMPLETED_CHAMP">Vikna. The trial has ended.&lt;page&gt;Bug not flea... impressive was your performance. Your score exceeds even my own.&lt;page&gt;To see skill so much, moments before everything ends, gives me unexpected joy.&lt;page&gt;Rishkiz... I congratulate you, champion.</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_BOARD_TITLE_DODGE">Dodge</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_MEET">Ahh, Miss Hornet! Greetings, and well met, once again!&lt;page&gt;The journey here was long, but we didn&#8217;t lose a single flea! And now fate has brought us back together again... what a marvel!&lt;hpage&gt;It is good to see you safe, Fleamaster. The journey to this moor from the caverns below is long and dangerous.&lt;page&gt;Dangerous, certainly, but we fleas are born to roam!&lt;page&gt;And now, you must go and see Grishkin, sitting there by the bubbling cauldron. After long travel, we drink to revive our spirits!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_WILD_MEET">Grrr.. bug not flea. Why you must bother me? This spot is mine, fair fought and earned.&lt;hpage&gt;I won&#8217;t stay long, madam. Nor would I contest your right to this cave.&lt;hpage&gt;I have encountered several of your fellows fleas, united in a caravan. Perhaps you would consider joining with them?&lt;hpage&gt;Yours seems a hardy hide, and I fear alone they lack the strength to survive long in this land.&lt;page&gt;Caravan? Grrr. Felt it in my fur... Time for change. If caravan is close, then my task, these lands, may near be complete.&lt;page&gt;Now... Grrr. Much talk I gave. You leave me! Meet again at caravan, amongst good fellows. There I share my learnings of fleas and Pharloom. Till then, rest I need! Off, bug!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GAMES_INTRO_TALK_2">Ohhhh! What other choice do we poor wretches have?! Cruel fate leaves us with only one last task...&lt;page&gt;Dear friend... Miss Hornet! Forgive us, but we beg one more favour from you. Will you accompany us in our final act...?</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_COMPLETED_CHAMP">Vikna! The game is ended, and we have a new Flea Juggle champion! Incredible!&lt;page&gt;Miss Hornet, with your skill I&#8217;m certain you could best all three of our games and become the grandest champion of them all!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SAVED_ACT3">My, what a sweet face now emerges from the darkness! Poor Kratt has been hiding here from those blackened beasts for too long, all alone!&lt;hpage&gt;The beasts and bugs ensnared by the black thread are dangerous indeed. You have done right to hide yourself from them, sir.&lt;hpage&gt;That metal carriage... It is yours, I assume?&lt;page&gt;Ooh, yes, yes! I&#8217;m setting out to join the nearest flea caravan, aren&#8217;t I? Safety in numbers, yes? I&#8217;ve had more than enough of venturing alone.&lt;page&gt;And you... I trust I will see you there? My carriage hides a special secret I&#8217;d gladly share with you when next we meet! Heh heh!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_COMPLETE_QUEST1">There are still many fleas for us to be united with though, and we&#8217;ve rested long enough. The caravan must head higher!&lt;page&gt;Oh but stranger, how remiss of me! I introduced myself earlier without ever asking for your own name. Forgive me! Please, what shall we call you?&lt;hpage&gt;You may call me Hornet, Fleamaster. Know that I, like you, am glad to see your fellow fleas safe with your caravan. These are dangerous lands to travel alone.&lt;hpage&gt;I still have a long journey ahead of me. If I come across any more fleas, I will assist where I am able.&lt;page&gt;Oh, vavenda! That is to say, incredible! What a beautiful thing for me to hear!&lt;page&gt;Dear friend... Miss Hornet. Our caravan must be away now, toward the wide moor high above. Would you travel with us, as our honoured guest?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_FLEATOPIA">So many awful places have us fleas travelled. Many times I almost die. But here is seems safe enough.&lt;page&gt;You will have rest too? Is space enough for us all now... friend.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_JUDGE">Welcome again, Miss Hornet! See how high our caravan has climbed, resting right on the doorstep of that mighty Citadel!&lt;hpage&gt;It is fortunate that all of your companions survive the trek, Fleamaster. The howling rise beside, and the tangled wood before it, have both claimed the lives of countless bugs.&lt;page&gt;Indeed! A perilous ascent! We have seen the many husks in passing. A mighty luck must shine on us, to journey with such success.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_COMPLETE_QUEST1_INTRO">Look, look! So many fleas have joined the caravan! What a miracle! We can not thank you enough for honouring our humble wish!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_MEET_ACT3">You remain, bug not flea? Would you seek service of me, ehh? Mine is knowledge much, the places of the lost little ones, heard and smelt across the caves.&lt;page&gt;You help find! And bring! Best we come together, we fleas all... now that times turn dark...</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_DECLINE">As you wish, sweet one. Shall we just rest here together on the shore of eternity instead?</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_SPA_PROMPT">Enter spa?</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_ACCEPT">Mamashka! I am saying, let the game begin! Flea Juggle!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_MEET_FLEATOPIA_TRAVELED">What a beautiful spot you&#8217;ve gifted us, Miss Hornet! Safe apart from the dark and death of the lands beside. A place for fleas to grow smart and strong.&lt;page&gt;Here we shall see our travels end, for in Pharloom there could be no finer place to settle.&lt;hpage&gt;I am glad the location suits, Fleamaster. It is a calming thing to know these many fleas may survive. Most bugs of Pharloom seem destined for far bleaker fates.&lt;page&gt;Indeed! A hopeful future awaits! And only because of yourself and your efforts. To commemorate our arrival, it would be my pleasure to perform a small service for you.&lt;page&gt;I have been learning to sew, and the little fleas have been gathering materials for me. I thought I could add an extra pocket to your tool pouch, to make your travels just a little easier.&lt;page&gt;A trifling favour, much less than you deserve, but still I hope it meets to your satisfaction!</entry>
<entry name="FG_BOUNCE_INTRO_CHAMP">My dear Flea Bounce champion, will you play with us again? Let us dance and fly above the waters until the world itself falls away!</entry>
<entry name="CARAVAN_LECH_ACT3_MEET">Sweet one! What a delight to see you emerge from the horrible darkness now enveloping the world!&lt;page&gt;Poor Kratt feared he would have only his mangy fellow fleas for company at the end of everything. How kind of you to spend your last moments here with me!</entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_BOARD_HORNET_NAME">Hornet</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ACCEPTED_WISHWALL_QUEST1_FULL">&lt;hpage&gt;Fleamaster, I took your request from the wishwall in the pilgrim camp. You are seeking fleas to join your caravan? I have found and freed many throughout my travels.&lt;page&gt;Oh yes, indeed! And look here, they all have made their way to us! So many gathered, it seems a miracle. Our wishes granted before even your promise was known!</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_COMPLETED">Vikna! The game is now ended, but you can play again, as much you wish... until the end of the world comes for us all!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_OFFER_QUEST1">Stranger, will you hear my worry? The time has come for us fleas to find each other and travel together, as has happened through generations before.&lt;page&gt;The many fleas of this kingdom should be flocking to our caravan, but times have become dangerous. You feel it too, yes? Our poor cousins, out there, in hiding!&lt;page&gt;Would you, could you, help us find these poor, lost fleas? We daren&#8217;t continue our journey until some of the poor dears have found their way here to us!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_TRAVEL_PROMPT">Travel with the Flea Caravan?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_LEAVE">Alas, Miss Hornet! Until our paths cross again, our dearest wishes go with you.&lt;hpage&gt;Safe travels to you and your troupe, Fleamaster. </entry>
<entry name="FESTIVAL_OUTRO_POST">And so the great ceremony has reached its climax and its grand champion has emerged!&lt;page&gt;Thank you for spending your last moments with us here, Miss Hornet.&lt;page&gt;Though the world will soon end, and our paradise will crumble, the memories of friendship we all shared shall surely echo through the oncoming void for all eternity!&lt;hpage&gt;Fleamaster, your sentiment is kind, but this world will not end.&lt;page&gt;Oh? How good of you to speak words of hope for our benefit, but we have accepted our fate. Come, let us forget the past and revel together!&lt;hpage&gt;It is not merely hope that I offer you sir, but a promise. This kingdom&#8217;s suffering has a singular cause, and by my own claw will it be cleansed.&lt;hpage&gt;Perhaps not every flea will survive what is coming... but the world will not die, and your settlement may still see chance to prosper.&lt;page&gt;Ahh? You speak... with such conviction. But I cannot bring myself to hope such, I am sorry.&lt;page&gt;Come what may, we fleas will be here until the end. And the games will continue, of course! Celebrate with us for as long as you wish, dear friend.</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_COMPLETED_CHAMP_TO_OUTRO">Vikna! The game is ended, and we have a new Flea Juggle champion! Incredible!&lt;page&gt;You have proven yourself the champion at each of our flea games!&lt;page&gt;I am confident now that the grand champion of our festival has emerged. It is none other than yourself, of course!&lt;page&gt;And thusly, must our final ceremony begin. Fleas, prepare yourselves!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_CANCELED">You not want my learnings, bug not flea? Rare it is we share such things with ones outside our own. </entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_CHOICE">Compete in Flea Juggle?</entry>
<entry name="FG_JUGGLE_INTRO_CHAMP">Miss Hornet, you are the greatest of us all in the Flea Juggle! But will you challenge yourself to ever higher achievements?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_TALL_MEET">Dodeshna, stranger. You are looking a little... tired, is it? Unhealthy?&lt;page&gt;You can rest with us here, if wish. Is nice and dark, and warmth from below brings good health.&lt;page&gt;Still, you should make care not to stay much long. You are not flea, after all.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_HUNTER_WILD_REPEAT_NOCARAVAN">You still here, bug? Is rest I need before I travel. Not chat. You is trouble-type. Make my shell tense.&lt;hpage&gt;I shall take my leave, madam. Stay strong on your own journey. May we meet again in more hospitable surrounds.</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_CANLEAVE_FULL">Look Miss Hornet! See the many lively fleas that form our caravan. Thanks to you and your hunting, so many are here! And all are eager again to travel!&lt;page&gt;We had once wished to match the numbers of our fabled past, yet now, we may even have exceeded them!&lt;hpage&gt;It is a welcome sight, Fleamaster, and the playful cheer about the caravan suggests you are a fine steward to the troupe.&lt;page&gt;Such kind words, Miss Hornet! How lucky we are to have found a friend so fair!&lt;page&gt;But now, we must away! These moors have been our host long enough. It is time to climb and hoist towards drier caves!&lt;page&gt;Good friend to fleas, would you join us on this next journey? </entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_JUDGE_TRAVEL">Marvellous! We fleas shall be overjoyed to have your company on the road.&lt;page&gt;Now! Our new home is calling. We must travel!</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_MEMBER_SHORT_REPEAT_GREYMOOR">I&#8217;m wonder at this land... Something heavy hangs above, like shadow. I&#8217;m hope the little fleas have not much danger here...</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_ACCEPTED_WISHWALL_QUEST1">&lt;hpage&gt;Fleamaster, I took your request from the wishwall in the pilgrim camp. You are seeking fleas to join your caravan?&lt;page&gt;Oh, yes! The time has come for us fleas to find each other and travel together, as has happened through generations before.&lt;page&gt;The many fleas of this kingdom should be flocking to our caravan, but times have become dangerous. You feel it too, yes? Our poor cousins, out there, in hiding!&lt;page&gt;But... do I understand you rightly, stranger? You will help find the the poor, lost fleas? Truly?</entry>
<entry name="TROUPE_LEADER_GREYMOOR_HAUNTEDBELLHART">That great vein of bells there... some of the fleas wanted to shelter inside, but I was not so sure. The whole creaking mass seems unstable! It makes me tremble!&lt;hpage&gt;You were wise not to head inside, Fleamaster. A silken curse has taken hold of the settlement within. Advise your fellows to avoid that place.&lt;page&gt;A curse you say?! W-well then! Our thanks are owed again. I shall let all fleas know they must not venture closer.</entry>
<entry name="FG_DODGE_COMPLETED">Vikna. The trial has ended. Your score can be seen on the board beside me. </entry>
