<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_PT2">&lt;page&gt;No. Not their enemy, and their prisoner not through malice. I am Eva, a thing... difficult to describe, a child of Weavers, yet not quite their kin...&lt;hpage&gt;How strange. That description could fit me as well as yourself. &lt;page&gt;Child of Weavers?... And not? I can detect your Weaver strain, yet you are different from them, and from me, a shifting, blended thing? What are you creature?&lt;page&gt;Step closer lady, that my senses would better understand your nature.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_REPEAT_ADDITIONAL">Lady, still my senses resound. You seem so far beyond the bounds of a bug.&lt;page&gt;Permit me to gaze again upon your nature, that I may offer clarity.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_ACT3">Lady? So you live, still. This is good... I had felt the conflict commence, pale hearts ablaze, and the sudden well of darkness after.&lt;hpage&gt;I am sorry, Eva. I had hoped to slay the monarch, and was near achieving that goal, but the situation has become... complicated. Now all of Pharloom threatens to fall.&lt;page&gt;But I can sense it in you, lady. You have not yielded to despair, so some hope must still remain?&lt;hpage&gt;...Slim hope, I suspect. But true, there may yet be a way through this disaster. I shall pursue that goal with whatever strength remains.&lt;page&gt;Then allow me to continue to aid you as I can... Mine might be a small contribution, but I shall provide it eagerly.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_POST_ADDITIONAL_AVAILABLE">Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bug&#8217;s. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing, worth my long life to behold.&lt;page&gt;With what power I possess, I may still be able to aid you further. </entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_TALK_SNARE">&lt;hpage&gt;Eva, I am seeking a tool, told to be somewhere in this structure. It is a snare device of Weaver make. Do you know of it?&lt;page&gt;I may, lady. Search over from here, on side where the moss meets the nest. There my mothers built their tools, all traps and bindings. Small things, but tests for larger forms.&lt;page&gt;I still remember their thoughts as they worked, their desperation, and their hunger. Another hopeless attempt to wrest their freedom. All ended in failure, of course.</entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_READY">Ain&#8217;t you come a long way, bellringer! Granting wishes, saving bugs, even rousing my sullen family to act!&lt;page&gt;The snare is set above, our power bound along its thread. To your sight it may seem a crude thing, but there&#8217;s fair strength to it... enough to quell a god.&lt;hpage&gt;You and your family have done me well, sir. I shall prove your faith in the meeting ahead.&lt;page&gt;Aye. Bring your best, bellringer. Call forth our great pale god. Cut her weak, then drive the beast down atop the snare.&lt;page&gt;Contact made will stir the snare alight, but only your needle&#8217;s song will awaken the spell in full. When that moment arrives, you&#8217;ll see it clear.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_RETURNED">&lt;page&gt;Lady, please. Permit me to look upon your nature, that I may offer clarity...</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_POST">Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bug&#8217;s. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing, worth my long life to behold.&lt;page&gt;If in your travels you are able to further evolve, return to me. With what power I possess, I may be able to aid you further.&lt;hpage&gt;Thank you, Eva. If my nature expands as you say, I shall return. </entry>
<entry name="CARETAKER_SNARE_TALK1">&lt;hpage&gt;I have known your kind before, sir. Yours is a tribe that works and trades in power, and I am about to extinguish its prime source.&lt;hpage&gt;Once this is done, will you truly delight in a land so bereft?&lt;page&gt;Aye, well... My family&#8217;s marks are all over that trap. And we&#8217;ve spent a hard age avoiding the gaze of our god.&lt;page&gt;If we earned it now, after such open opposition... that&#8217;s a bleak conclusion none of us&#8217;d care for.&lt;page&gt;Now! My job&#8217;s done. S&#8217;time your grand business began! We&#8217;ll be wishin&#8217; victory to you, bellringer, for all our sakes!</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE">&lt;hpage&gt;You see one&#8217;s nature, Eva? It is a skill far beyond bugs.&lt;page&gt;One not without cost. My sight perceives a bug only through the imprint upon their soul. &lt;hpage&gt;You speak of their crest? That signifier of a bug&#8217;s essence and their invisible yoke born through a lifetime.&lt;page&gt;Crest? Yes, the old Weaver term. A simple word to attempt description of something so profound.&lt;page&gt;But wait. Your own nature... Is it?...&lt;page&gt;Lady, permit me to look deeper still, that I may offer clarity...</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PROMPT">Allow Insight?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_REPEAT_ACT3">Lady, Pharloom&#8217;s time grows short. If you are able to further expand your nature I urge you return to me.&lt;page&gt;Any power I possess, I shall grant it for your aid.&lt;hpage&gt;My thanks, Eva. If my nature expands as you say, I shall return. </entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_ACCEPT_DIALOGUE">Bind Eva?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_CURSED">Stay back, twisted leech! Even lodged within another&#8217;s shell, your ravenous nature shines clear.&lt;page&gt;You shall not defoul this chamber, nor claim my soul. Begone!</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_FIRST_ALL">Lady... Incredible... Your nature is so unlike a mortal bugs. Yours is malleable, transitory. It is a marvelous thing. Worth my long life to behold.&lt;page&gt;Unbound one, though we know each other little, permit me to ask a selfish request.&lt;hpage&gt;Your talent has provided a great benefit, Eva. What is it you desire of me?&lt;page&gt;Only to have my own soul, my own memories, bound within your shell... As you have done with those others throughout these lands.&lt;page&gt;I would not define as a crest within you, but my small strength may still grant a final boon.&lt;hpage&gt;You ask to be subsumed? Know your mind would cease to be, in any independent sense.&lt;page&gt;To be united with one unbound... This is the kind of escape I once prayed for, though the weight of ages had almost made me forget.&lt;page&gt;Lady, would you grant me this request?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_ALL">Lady, you are a multitude within a single shell. A being truly unbound. To aid your growth has proved a grand task, even for one as limited as me.&lt;page&gt;As my last act, permit me to ask a final, selfish request.&lt;hpage&gt;Your talents have provided great benefit, Eva. What is it you desire of me?&lt;page&gt;Only to have my own soul, my own memories, bound within your shell... As you have done with those others throughout these lands.&lt;page&gt;I would not define as a crest within you, but my small strength may still grant a final boon.&lt;hpage&gt;You ask to be subsumed? Know your mind would cease to be, in any independent sense.&lt;page&gt;I know. And still I seek it, gladly. To be united with one unbound... This is the kind of escape I once prayed for, though the weight of ages had almost made me forget.&lt;page&gt;Dear Lady, would you grant me this request?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET">Who&#8217;s there? Has someone come to free me? Or are you here to bring my end? &lt;hpage&gt;I am Hornet, prisoner, only a traveller and not here to slay you.&lt;hpage&gt;What cause sees you caged in these ruins of Weavers past? Were you their enemy?</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_PRE_REPEAT">Lady, my senses resound. You have grown further beyond the bounds of a bug.&lt;page&gt;Permit me to gaze again upon your nature, that I may offer clarity.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_TALK_PURPOSE">&lt;hpage&gt;How did you come to be sealed here, Eva? &lt;page&gt;Lady, you mistake. What seems a cage is as much my shell as the form inside.&lt;page&gt;I was born within this space. To leave would be my death, an uninspired end, though one I&#8217;ve sometimes wished would come.&lt;page&gt;I am unique, you see. My mothers shared the curse of their tribe, to conceive a child is a painful, near impossible task. &lt;hpage&gt;I know the curse well, Eva, for I am also it&#8217;s victim, and spawn of one who managed to overcome its limits. &lt;hpage&gt;Are you too an attempt to defy that cruel constraint?&lt;page&gt;A flawed attempt. A life spun from rune and shell, sustained only by its cage. My thoughts may mimic a Weavers but my senses are my own.&lt;page&gt;Over time, that difference brought only distance between us.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_ACCEPT">By your grace, I am at last broken from my fate.&lt;hpage&gt;Gladly I accept your union, Eva. No longer shall you suffer eternity alone.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_MEET_OVERBLUE">Come no closer! I sense the forbidden blood coursing through you, that which grows and reshapes the world in its own vulgar image.&lt;page&gt;Whether it was imbibed willingly or not, none shall be allowed into this chamber while so afflicted. Begone!</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_REPEAT">Lady, if in your travels you are able to further expand your nature, return to me. With what power I possess, I may be able to aid you further.&lt;hpage&gt;If my nature expands as you say, Eva, I shall return. </entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_REOFFER">Lady, would you think again upon my last request? To be bound amidst your shimmering soul?&lt;page&gt;I understand it is a selfish thing to ask, and I will hold no ill will if you reject.</entry>
<entry name="CREST_UPGRADE_DECLINE">&lt;hpage&gt;I am sorry, Eva. I cannot grant you this. At least, not yet.&lt;hpage&gt;Yours is a mind strong and strange. That union could prove dangerous to my identity.&lt;page&gt;I understand, Lady. I will be here, if ever you reconsider.</entry>
