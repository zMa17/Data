<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_PROMPT">Purchase Vintage Nectar?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_GREET_ACT3">Ho, traveller! With the lands outside fresh struck by fell events, it&#8217;s good to see someone still survivin&#8217;.&lt;hpage&gt;This new curse proves a threat even to my strengthened shell. For your own safety, barkeep, I strongly suggest you remain within your walls.&lt;page&gt;Aye, well you&#8217;re welcome to do the same. Stay and wash the troubles away with a few bells of nectar... though, given the scale to them shakes, I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; it might take more&#8217;n just a few.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_CURSED">Phew. You&#8217;re lookin&#8217; a bit raw there, miss. I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217; it&#8217;ll take more than my nectar to fix you up.&lt;hpage&gt;A parasite of your land has twisted itself into my shell. Its writhing is causing some discomfort.&lt;hpage&gt;If not for my unique constitution, I suspect it would have already consumed me entirely.&lt;page&gt;Well don&#8217;t be bringing such dangerous things in here! Head to the top of the moors. There&#8217;s an old doctor up there hiding in her bell.&lt;page&gt;Her remedies are said to often hurt more&#8217;n they help but, given your state, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s worth the risk.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_OFFER">&lt;hpage&gt;Bartender, I&#8217;ve been tasked to acquire a nectar of significant age. Would you retain any such drink?&lt;page&gt;After the finer stuff, eh? Sure I might have a few vessels left, but I can&#8217;t be selling &#8216;em cheap.&lt;page&gt;The shells in my cellar are the last left in Pharloom. Once they&#8217;re gone, no bug&#8217;ll ever taste such sweetness again.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_DRINK_DECLINED">&lt;hpage&gt;Another time, perhaps. Among the few gifts of my birth, I find rare need for sustenance.&lt;page&gt;S&#8217;at so? Well the nectar&#8217;s always on tap if you find yourself feelin&#8217; different.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_REOFFER">&lt;page&gt;Thinkin&#8217; again on the Vintage Nectar?&lt;page&gt;My price might seem steep, but I assure you the few finer bugs who passed used to pay a lot more.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_REPEAT">Any chance you&#8217;d reconsider dealing with my blasted craw problem? I&#8217;d offer fair reward for your efforts.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_QUEST">Traveller, I&#8217;m not wanting to impose, but I&#8217;ve a wish that one of your able sort could likely grant.&lt;hpage&gt;I&#8217;ve my own task to attend, good sir, but I&#8217;ll hear you out.&lt;page&gt;It&#8217;s those blasted craws atop here. My roof is fast becoming their cosy nest! Now they&#8217;ve grown so bold they&#8217;re starting to attack pilgrims as they pass.&lt;hpage&gt;Would you simply have them slain? If so, your sturdy shell seems more than up to that task?&lt;page&gt;If only it were so simple. Kill the ones above and more just keep coming. It&#8217;s the warmth of this home you see. Draws &#8216;em right in.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;m looking for a long-term solution. A scarecraw! I&#8217;ll build the biggest there&#8217;s ever been, so fearsome it&#8217;ll keep those craws away for good!</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_LEFT_TALK_1">Tis a blessed bit of luck to find this place, eh sister?&lt;page&gt;The climb&#8217;s proved harder than even my best guessin&#8217;, but there&#8217;s still some vigour left in these old limbs. Doubly so, now I have a belly full of nectar!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_REPEAT">Care for a drink, traveller? My nectar&#8217;s got a kick that&#8217;ll warm your shell in these sodden climes.</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_RIGHT_TALK_1">Hoy... sister! I&#8217;m sat here all bent and bedraggled, but you look fresh as the day you was hatched!&lt;page&gt;How do you fare so well in these drenched and dangerous lands? Maybe you got a secret you could share?&lt;hpage&gt;None that would offer easy aid, good bug. Whatever luck or savvy brought you this far, may it continue on your journey.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_DECLINE">&lt;hpage&gt;For now, bartender, I cannot spare so many rosaries.&lt;page&gt;Suit yourself. Maybe you&#8217;d rather a pour of the cheap stuff? Give your shell a kick before you head out into our blighted lands.  </entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_BELLHARTHAUNTED">&lt;hpage&gt;My travels took me through a town beside your moors, in a vein of old bells. Its residents are bound upon a vicious thread.&lt;page&gt;Ahh. So Pharloom&#8217;s curse has strung&#8217;em tight. A frightful thing. Word&#8217;d long gone silent from over their way.&lt;hpage&gt;I suggest you pass warning to your patrons, bartender. If they&#8217;re travelling the bellside paths, best they give that place wide berth.&lt;page&gt;Aye. I&#8217;ll let&#8217;em know, traveller, though in these cursed times, does any safe path still exist?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_CURSED_REPEAT">Best be visiting that doctor right quick, miss! She&#8217;s up there, at the top of the moors, over toward the bellvein.&lt;page&gt;Her methods might be suspect, but you&#8217;re lookin&#8217; sorely in need of service.</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_LEFT_TALK_REPEAT">Might have taken me a beat to build the courage, but I can feel it, closer now... the Citadel calling me up.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE">&lt;hpage&gt;Here is the Ragpelt, sir. I hope the amount is sufficient for your work.&lt;page&gt;Aye. This should be enough. Once I find a quiet moment, I&#8217;ll get straight to building that mighty scarecraw.&lt;page&gt;With a little luck, my roof should be clear of those pests when next you pass by. Thank you kindly, traveller!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_ACTIVE">If you&#8217;re collecting Ragpelt from the crawbugs, those young&#8217;ns above here&#8217;ll be slim pickings. It&#8217;s the mature craws you want, over by the watermound. They&#8217;ll drop the stuff a-plenty.&lt;page&gt;Course you&#8217;ll need to do some pointed persuading if you&#8217;re planning to separate rag from bug...</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_GOT">You&#8217;re back, miss! Heard a little commotion below. I trust everything went... erm, smoothly?&lt;hpage&gt;&lt;hpage&gt;Sir, your cellar seems to have an ant problem. I assume, in sending me down, it merely slipped your mind to mention?&lt;page&gt;Ah... Oh yes! Well with your weapon, and talent, and what... I&#8217;m sure they didn&#8217;t pose a problem? Ahem.&lt;page&gt;And why! I see you&#8217;ve collected your prize, so we&#8217;ve both come out well from the trade!&lt;page&gt;Enjoy your nectar, miss. No simple pilgrim will ever taste a drop so fine.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_DECLINE_QUEST">Ahh. Fair enough, traveller. You&#8217;ve clearly got your own tasks to be on with. I&#8217;ll manage, no doubt.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE_2">As payment goes, I&#8217;ve got something I think you&#8217;d make good use of. A spare crafting kit.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;d been holding onto it for someone else, but they&#8217;ve been gone long enough now I know they won&#8217;t be returning.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_COMPLETE_3">&lt;hpage&gt;Thank you sir. This is a worthy trade for my work. My tools shall attain an even sharper edge.</entry>
<entry name="HH_PATRON_RIGHT_TALK_REPEAT">My sore shell will cease tormenting me once I reach the Citadel. It&#8217;s sung that all ails are healed just as soon as we step beyond the Grand Gate...</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_ACCEPT">Aye. A fair trade. The aged stuff&#8217;s down at the bottom of the cellar.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;ll trust you to collect only the vessel you&#8217;re owed. I&#8217;d be grabbing it myself, but it&#8217;s become a hard climb for my stiffened shell.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_1">S&#8217;only those few stronger pilgrims that survive to reach my home now... Pharloom&#8217;s curse claims the rest. Poor sods, left to wander.&lt;page&gt;I do sometimes get to wondering... Is it the dregs of their own mind in there keepin&#8217;em walking, or something else entirely...?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_2">Bellhart, over the moors, a great town I&#8217;ve heard it once was, heart of the path&#8217;n all, right smack in the middle of these midlands.&lt;page&gt;Now its all a&#8217;crumble... And that brittle vein of bells is crawling with nasties. Ain&#8217;t no place left in Pharloom that can fairly claim to offer safety. </entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_RUMOUR_3">You visited them pens up above here, miss? Horrid place, once all about growing meat or some such. Meant to keep us moorbugs livin&#8217;, and working, its told...&lt;page&gt;That damned place&#8217;s long gone to the Haunting. And now the meat&#8217;s running feral and free.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_CANCOMPLETE">Welcome back, traveller. How&#8217;d you get along with collecting the Ragpelt from those mangy crawbugs? Their squawking and crooing up there is starting to wear mightily on my patrons!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_DRINK_PROMPT">Buy a drink?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_DECLINEPELTS">Hmm, holding on to them eh? I won&#8217;t ask why, but I&#8217;d sure appreciate it if you reconsider.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_NECTAR_PAID">Planning to grab that Vintage Nectar? You passed a fair bundle of rosaries for the bottle so I figured you&#8217;ll be eager to see it yours.&lt;page&gt;The old stuff&#8217;s down there, at the bottom of the cellar. I&#8217;ll keep the trap open for you, just be swift. </entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_GREET">Harh! Well met, traveller. Lookin for a drink, or a rest, or both?&lt;hpage&gt;Fair greetings, good bug. The warmth of your hearth is welcome upon these wet plains.&lt;page&gt;Aye. It&#8217;s a damp climb through these parts. Used to be just pilgrims trekkin&#8217; my way, but odd times these are, and you ain&#8217;t even the strangest shell wandering about.&lt;page&gt;A rowdy old warrior stopped through not long back, caused quite a scene, and now a young lass&#8217;s taken up lodging in my top room.&lt;page&gt;The lass mentioned she&#8217;s on the look-out for sharp types like yourself. Maybe pay her a visit, if you haven&#8217;t already?</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_ACCEPT_QUEST">Excellent, excellent! Let&#8217;s give those mangy craws the fright of their lives! Hah!&lt;page&gt;All I need is some Ragpelt from the crawbugs themselves. Hunt &#8216;em down, collect their pelts, and bring me back a heap of the stuff. I&#8217;ll do the rest!</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_QUEST_ACTIVE_2">The sooner you&#8217;ve collected that Ragpelt the better. I can&#8217;t have those pests killing more potential guests.&lt;page&gt;Business is slow enough already, and clearing corpses ain&#8217;t no fun at all.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_REPEAT_ACT3">Wantin&#8217; for a drink, traveller? Might soon be the end for all&#8217;o us, so no need to go easy on the nectar.</entry>
<entry name="HH_BARTENDER_OFFER_QUEST_WISHWALL">&lt;hpage&gt;Barkeep, I have seen your request on the bell town&#8217;s wishwall. What assistance are you seeking?&lt;page&gt;Ah! Perfect! You&#8217;re the able sort that&#8217;ll make short work of the task.&lt;page&gt;The problem is those blasted craws atop here. My roof is fast becoming their cosy nest! Now they&#8217;ve grown so bold they&#8217;re starting to attack pilgrims as they pass.&lt;hpage&gt;Would you simply have me slay them? Your sturdy shell seems more than up to that task.&lt;page&gt;If only it were so simple. Kill the ones above and more just keep coming. It&#8217;s the warmth of this home you see. Draws &#8216;em right in.&lt;page&gt;I&#8217;m looking for a long-term solution. A scarecraw! I&#8217;ll build the biggest there&#8217;s ever been, so fearsome it&#8217;ll keep those craws away for good!&lt;page&gt;All I need is some Ragpelt from the crawbugs themselves. Hunt &#8216;em down, collect their pelts, and bring me back a heap of the stuff. I&#8217;ll do the rest!</entry>
