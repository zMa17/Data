<entry name="TRADERS_QUEST_OFFER">&lt;hpage&gt;The roaches outside, why are they kept in pens? They seem a dangerous creature to cage or tame.&lt;page=S&gt;Us moorbugs gotta eat, don&#8217;t we? They&#8217;re wild fast breeders, them Muckroaches. Hard shells and tough meat, if you can even crack &#8216;em open, but options ain&#8217;t plentiful so we ain&#8217;t choosy.&lt;page=S&gt;Ain&#8217;t so bad to eat, once you&#8217;re used to it. The guts is the best bit, but them&#8217;s a choice cut and we ain&#8217;t had it for ages now.&lt;page=L&gt;Har har, life is tough all right! Benj&#8217;n here&#8217;s wasting away before us, poor wretch!&lt;page=L&gt;Tugs at your emotions, eh missy? How &#8216;bout you put that poker to good use? Go poach some of them roaches and get us some tasty guts. There&#8217;d be fair trade waitin&#8217; for you.</entry>
<entry name="GRUBFARMER_DELIVERY">&lt;hpage&gt;Sir, I have brought a Queen&#8217;s Egg, at request of Bellhart&#8217;s couriers. It was a hazardous journey but the creature inside has made it here alive.&lt;page&gt;Sssssss! How sss-ssublime! To think that my dear misss-stress would be the one to deliver the preciousss package! I had feared for the competence of those feeble couriersss...&lt;hpage&gt;It surprises me to know you correspond with them. I must wonder where else you go and who else you speak to after you scurry back up into the darkness...&lt;page&gt;Ssss. My whispersss-ss travel far, misstressss. You need not worry yourssself with my comingsss and goingss-ss. All I do... is in your sssss-service.&lt;page&gt;And now, pleasssse... give her to me... the little queen!</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_TALK_GENERIC_2">&lt;hpage&gt;The beasts outside and their masters alike are all ensnared by this land&#8217;s silken affliction.You are lucky bugs to have not succumbed.&lt;page=L&gt;The Haunting? Oh, we&#8217;s got that all worked out. Benj&#8217;n and me are a right pair of philosophers when we bend our minds to it.&lt;page=L&gt;It&#8217;s faith that gets you. It&#8217;s all caused by being too devout!&lt;page=S&gt;Yeah! Or maybe not bein&#8217; devout enough!&lt;page=L&gt;Or maybe it&#8217;s safest not to think about it at all. Har har!</entry>
<entry name="GRUBFARMER_GROWING_ACT3">While you sss-stalk through the black-ravaged world, morsss-ssels will I grow. For the promiss-sse of what my misss-tress will become... I will toil, alwayssss...</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_TALK_GENERIC_1">&lt;page=S&gt;It&#8217;s said the moors used to grow a bounty of fresh food, way back befores that Citadel set us about catchin&#8217; their fallin&#8217; thread.&lt;page=S&gt;Sounds right lovely, eh missy? Always eatin&#8217;, never troubled by no grumblin&#8217; belly?&lt;page=L&gt;Har har! Yer like a hatchling, Benj&#8217;n! So given to fancies! &lt;page=L&gt;Now breedin&#8217; roaches is what keeps us from starvin&#8217;. Dangerous work, and not the finest diet, but we ain&#8217;t complainin&#8217;.&lt;page=L&gt;Specially as more and more of them keepers are succumbing to the strange sickness. Only means more meat for us. Har!</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_TALK_REPEAT">&lt;page=L&gt;We&#8217;re all fine here, miss. Content, like. P&#8217;raps it were time you made your way, eh?&lt;page=S&gt;Yeah, be on your way! And, erm, thanks for yer help there.</entry>

I am yoursss, my mistress, and you muss-sst protect me!&lt;page&gt;Sss-ssee what I have built here! Prepared, for the coming of my mistressss.

Promises is easily broken. But then, so&#8217;s a lot of other things. How &#8216;bout you reconsider yer greed there, missy?</entry>
<entry name="TRADERS_PINS_DECLINE">&lt;page=S&gt;Oi! You ain&#8217;t got the beads? Or you just not wantin&#8217; to part with &#8216;em? &lt;page=L&gt;Hardly the time to be a miser, missy. You&#8217;re gonna be livin&#8217; sick till you buy these spines from us.</entry>

<entry name="TRADERS_PINS_OFFER">&lt;hpage&gt;Good bugs, I am here on request of the doctor Yarnaby. She requires spines forged of steel, for a crucial operation.&lt;page=L&gt;Argh! Look at &#8216;er, Benj&#8217;n. She&#8217;s all sick like! Coiled up tight with somethin&#8217; weird. I reckon that operation&#8217;s for her herself!&lt;page=S&gt;She&#8217;s a sad sight for sure Crull, but sick or not our scrap&#8217;s hard-found. If she&#8217;s wantin&#8217;, we&#8217;s gotta be gettin&#8217; paid!&lt;page=L&gt;Ah! &#8216;Fraid the little one speaks true, missy.

<entry name="PRINCE_CELL_REPEAT">Leave it, bug. I accept my place.&lt;hpage&gt;Very well, prisoner.</entry>
<entry name="GRUBFARMER_NEEDOLIN">Sssss! Such sssss-sounds, plucked from the air and caught in your Silk! A marvel, my misss-stress...&lt;hpage&gt;It is a skill that any can learn. You could master this sound yourself, if you cared to.&lt;page&gt;No... a slave must grow morsels for his mistresssss. But the sssound... is so ssssss-soothing...</entry>
<entry name="GRUBFARMER_DELIVERY_POST_SETUP">It is done. Our nessst is larger, and the little queen beginssss her toil. &lt;page&gt;More morsss-ssels can I grow for you now! Are you pleasss-sed with me, my missstress-ss?&lt;hpage&gt;You are diligent at your work, and have raised no claw against me.

<entry name="GRUBFARMER_OPENED1">Ssss! Mistress, is the morsss-sssel I grew worthy? You must conss-sume... conssss-sume and become sss-stronger.&lt;page&gt;Thissss is how I will sss-sserve my misstress-ss. While you hunt, I will prepare morsssels. Alwaysss, preparing them for my mighty misssss-tresss...&lt;hpage&gt;Continue this work if it pleases you sir, but do not call me your mistress, for I am not.&lt;page&gt;Sss... but you are... missstress.

We&#8217;ll be eatin&#8217; like they do up in the Citadel soon enough!&lt;page=L&gt;And what about you, missy? You be joinin&#8217; us for this exquisite meal?&lt;hpage&gt;I&#8217;m afraid not, sirs. I must keep moving, and I fear the taste of such a delicacy is wasted on me.&lt;page=L&gt;I was hopin&#8217; as much. Two can sing, but three&#8217;s too many, eh? Har har!&lt;page=L&gt;Still, maybe this tool is enough for you to &#8216;member us by? A pointed weapon of me own makin&#8217;, from when I used to wrangle the Muckroaches meself.

<entry name="TRADERS_QUEST_ACTIVE_REPEAT">&lt;page=L&gt;We&#8217;re still waitin&#8217; on them roach guts you promised us, missy. Patiently, but not too patiently, you get me?&lt;page=S&gt;You can find the Muckroaches all &#8216;round these roads. Cut one down and reach inside its shell to pull out the tasty guts!

<entry name="GRUBFARM_MIMIC_NOGRUB">Not right. Nothing. Go.</entry>
<entry name="PRINCE_CELL_TALK">Leave me be, traveller. Better I accept this kingdom&#8217;s cruelty than rage helpless against it.&lt;page&gt;To waste in a cell, forgotten. &#8216;Tis no worse a fate than the Haunting that binds Pharloom&#8217;s many fragile minds.&lt;hpage&gt;As you wish, prisoner.</entry>
