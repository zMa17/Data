<entry name="DESC_WRAITH">Anguished spectre of lingering thread. Despite its ephemeral nature, strong strikes can dispel the Wraith for a time.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_GARMOND">A tragic fate for a once honourable bug. Those void soaked threads... Their physical might is nothing compared to the corruption they wreak upon a soul.</entry>
<entry name="NAME_BONE_ROLLER">Mawling</entry>
<entry name="NAME_SPLINTER_QUEEN">Sister Splinter</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_CRYSTAL_DRIFTER">The coldshard, even when destroyed it remembers its former shape. A remarkable material, and perhaps even more astonishing there seems life contained within it.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_ROACHKEEPER_CHEF_TINY">Roachserver</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_WEAVER_SERVITOR_LARGE">The servitor has been heavily damaged by time and the elements. Its actions have grown erratic. It seems no longer able to discern friend from foe.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_CORAL_SWIMMER_LARGE">A unique mask and impressive form. Now just another near forgotten specimen of this land before the monarch.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_HUNTER_TINY">These bugs work mainly as finders and foragers for the warriors of their tribe. Combat has not long been their nature.</entry>

<entry name="DESC_UNDERSTORE_HEAVY">Heavy, hard-shelled worker, forever repairing the Citadel&#8217;s crumbling Underworks.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_FIELDS_GOOMBA">It has no means to defend itself. Its only hope for survival is to be mistaken for a plant.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_BEAST">This one has allied themself with me, either as thanks for their saving or respect for one judged as equal. Whichever the reason, their fellowship is welcome.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SONG_PILGRIM_01">Bugs like these crossed the caves to bring me to Pharloom. I cut down many before my capture. Then I had thought them minded and cunning. Now I can see the singular will that haunts them all. </entry>
<entry name="NAME_CORAL_FLYER">Kakri</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_SPITTER">Its sticky spit would no doubt make a useful crafting material if moulded fresh. Unfortunately, I cannot stop to experiment.</entry>

<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_HIKER">A bug once frail, pushed by twisted thread beyond its mortal limits. </entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SWAMP_GOOMBA">The threat of its exploding rear is an effective deterrent to predators, but the slightest jolt or fall can cause its premature end.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_WISP">To live only a single, bright moment... What would one feel? Is it glorious, or only despair? Or could it be both, mixed equal?</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_ROACHKEEPER">Though their mind is largely lost their skill with a chain has not been forgotten. Does the Haunting eternally bind a bug to the task it had in life?</entry>

<entry name="NOTE_BONE_HUNTER_FLY">In my youth, I envied all bugs with wings. I even fancied I might grow a pair... I have since learned better. Accept the limitations of one&#8217;s body... and augment with tools as needed.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_WRAITH">Wraith</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SONG_REED_GRAND">This bug bears a spool of Silk, which they flail to attack. Though somewhat crude, theirs is a technique much reminiscent of Weavers. I wonder who taught them such a use?</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_FLOWER_QUEEN">Her presence would once have maintained the wood&#8217;s fragile order, allowing the safe passage of bugs across its branches.</entry>

<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_BELLTHROWER_FLY">On uneven terrain their union of flight and range can prove a challenge even for me.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_UNDERSTORE_POKER">They toiled incessantly for the Citadel, their shells bent and greyed, and now the kingdom&#8217;s curse means not even death can relieve them.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SHELLWOOD_WASP">Destroying the hives will limit their presence in the wood. Useful to me now, as I pass along the branches. Dangerous in time for the wood&#8217;s order. Even a small disruption can tip a fragile balance.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SONG_AUTOMATON_SHIELD">It has no true mind, and yet fights effectively, adjusting its strategy to my movements. Where exactly are its thoughts written?</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_LACE">A bug born entirely of thread. Much Silk would have been needed to see her sustained. A fragile form of life, but life nonetheless.</entry>
<entry name="NAME_SWAMP_SHAMAN">Groal the Great</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_MITE">Individually they offer little challenge, but their numbers are surely vast and most remain hidden.</entry>

<entry name="DESC_CRYSTAL_DRIFTER_GIANT">Huge flighted creature formed from coldshard.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SHAKRA">She has lived a mere fraction of my lifetime and yet her rings prove a ferocious match. As gifted a warrior as I have ever encountered, and one I am fortunate to call a friend.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_THUMPER">Sheer bulk makes for an effective weapon, but requires much sustenance. This creature would have spent most of its time eating. An acceptable life for some.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_ABYSS_CRAWLER_LARGE">These ones grow large, yet I have never observed them eating, or sleeping. They seem such simple bugs... but I suspect they are not truly our cousins.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_BONE_BEAST">Huge, hardbone bug that lives within and travels through the veins of old bells across Pharloom.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_PILGRIM_03_SONG">Winged devout of the Citadel, carrying a brace of gilded bells.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PEAKS_DRIFTER">This one would make a perfect pet, but for the freezing temperatures it requires for comfort.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_DUSTROACH_POLLYWOG">These creatures look to have been bred deliberately in watery pens. If they are food to be, their scent suggests they must taste vile.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_HUNTER_CHIEF">Their skill once saw them chosen, and I can plainly see why. They would have lived and trained only for this duty.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_04_SONG">For this bug to have survived Pharloom&#8217;s climb it must have teamed with stouter companions. I cannot imagine it succeeding alone.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_02_SONG">Did this one grow large thanks to the Citadel&#8217;s excess, or was its formidable size the reason it ever survived to reach this place?</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SKULL_KING">Though surely fierce, the skull it bears looks taken from an even larger beast. If not for the bones as proof, I would scarcely believe bugs could grow to such scale.</entry>

<entry name="DESC_PILGRIM_03">Basic bug of Pharloom, laid low upon the ground.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_CRAWLER">I am fond of simple, effective traps such as this bug&#8217;s extendable spikes. An unwary predator would be skewered clean through.</entry>

<entry name="NOTE_LAST_JUDGE">The huge Judge likely stood through countless generations, never defeated, never wavering in their charge.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_UNDERSTORE_SMALL">Underworker</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_FLOWER_DRIFTER">Quite a beautiful creature. In my own kingdom&#8217;s court it would have been highly favoured as an ornamental pet.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_HOPPER_GIANT">There is surprising strength hidden in their thin, elegant limbs. It would be a pleasure to ride upon it...</entry>

<entry name="NAME_FARMER_WISP">Burning Bug</entry>
<entry name="DESC_SHIELD_DOCK_WORKER">Cymbal bearing worker of the Deep Docks. Pans the hauls of smokerock to find traces of more precious minerals.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_TAR_SLUG">Sticky mollusc that defends itself by spraying burning fluid from growths on its back.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SWAMP_DRIFTER">This one is pretty, but not as soft as first it seems. The plant it mimics is flaked and coarse, and the bug&#8217;s coat shares similar texture.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_DOCK_WORKER">Low level worker lost to Pharloom&#8217;s Haunting. Instinct keeps them at their task, though in much simpler fashion than before.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BLADE_SPIDER">Something in their assault reminds me of my own skill, though their talents are born purely of instinct. My technique is formed from hard training.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_ROACHKEEPER_CHEF">Disgraced Chef Lugoli</entry>
<entry name="DESC_FARMER_CATCHER">Bug charged to catch dregs of Silk that fall from the Citadel. Will attack with its staff if provoked.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_MOSSBONE_MOTHER">Moss Mother</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SONG_AUTOMATON_01">Its core is filled with fine mechanisms, but that alone should not produce such a convincing mimic of life. Silk must also be used to animate this artifice, though exactly how I am not sure.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_STICK_INSECT_CHARGER">Its shell gives it the advantage of surprise, but also forces it into a slender, brittle shape that cannot withstand a heavy attack.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_LILYPAD_TRAP">Predatory plant with a powerful jaw shaped to resemble a lily pad.</entry>
<entry name="NAME_SHIELD_DOCK_WORKER">Smokerock Sifter</entry>

<entry name="DESC_HORNET_DRAGONFLY">Flighty insect that lives beside still waters.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_SONG_HANDMAIDEN">Clawmaiden</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_04">Birth equipped this one well. In its assault it becomes its own projectile.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_DOCK_CHARGER">Their heavier bells armour them well against my strikes, but against that oppressive heat... can they help at all?</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_02">A rare built bug within these ailing lands. Most pilgrims&#8217; shells seem small by comparison. What nourishment did they discover to grow so large?</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_01">With a softer shell than most, they would have relied on their athleticism to survive.</entry>

<entry name="DESC_CROW">Screeching scavenger that roosts high in caverns and preys on passing pilgrims.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_STICK_INSECT">Insect formed to imitate a branch, capable of remaining perfectly still for long periods, but unexpectedly swift when roused.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_CRYSTAL_DRIFTER_GIANT">This larger form carries so much weight it can barely move from its place.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_CROWMAN_DAGGER">Squatcraw</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SONG_AUTOMATON_FLY_SPIKE">I cannot decipher its function to the greater Core. Is it built for defence? If so, its passivity seems far from optimal.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_MOSSBONE_CRAWLER">If not for the spikes, I would think it an appealing bug.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_SWAMP_MOSQUITO_SKINNY">Hovering pest with a hollowed proboscis able to spit gobs of sizzling bile.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SURFACE_SCUTTLER">This surface dweller is free of Silk. Its nature remains its own. The monarch&#8217;s influence must only have stretched below it.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SCROLLKEEPER">Did they ever truly understand those inscrutable scrolls? Or is it all merely pretence, an endless act to maintain their order&#8217;s station within the Citadel?</entry>
<entry name="NAME_CORAL_SPIKE_GOOMBA">Coral Furm</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_STICK_INSECT_FLYER">Its assault... like a young bug&#8217;s toy turned deadly. Could I, in time, fashion a spinning tool to match?</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PHANTOM">Though grey with age, their frayed form suggested a being strung from Silk, one who welcomed a decisive end in combat over a slow decline.</entry>
<entry name="NAME_GIANT_FLEA">Huge Flea</entry>
<entry name="DESC_SMALL_CRAB">Infant form of the more formidable Craggler. </entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_GOOMBA_LARGE">Either its size has made it fearless or the Haunting has removed its sense of self-preservation.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_ZAP_CORE_ENEMY">Barely a bug, and possessing only basic thought, yet instinct alone proved enough to turn it deadly.</entry>
<entry name="NAME_SONG_AUTOMATON_FLY_SPIKE">Cogwork Spine</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SAND_CENTIPEDE">Bursts forth at movement sensed close, and will consume any object or bug careless enough to fall into its maw.</entry>

<entry name="DESC_MITE">Verminous pest, common throughout the dark corners of Greymoor.</entry>

<entry name="NAME_VAMPIRE_GNAT">Moorwing</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_SPINNER_BOSS">Her body seemed a Weaver&#8217;s, but her mask had been forcibly removed, and her own Silk was bound useless by heavy pins lodged through her spine.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_GRASSHOPPER_CHILD">Fierce and fast, and defending their lands even from birth. These are children to be proud of. </entry>
<entry name="NOTE_CITADEL_BAT">Like fabric somehow sprung to life. Its pelt is perfectly matched to the rags it infests. </entry>
<entry name="NOTE_BONE_CIRCLER_VICIOUS">Its wings are quite small compared to its bulk. Perhaps it uses the warm air of these fiery lands to help stay airborne. Clever, if so.</entry>
<entry name="DESC_SONG_ADMINISTRATOR">Gold ranked disciple of the Choir and direct servant to the Citadel&#8217;s Conductors.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_PILGRIM_STAFFWIELDER">The large bell seems to signify them as once leader of a climbing troupe, though the Haunting has erased that former authority.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_STICK_INSECT">Avoiding their ambush is a good test of my senses, and my ability to rapidly retaliate.</entry>
<entry name="NOTE_LOST_LACE">To quell the mother&#8217;s rage, and see this kingdom saved, I will claim her back. This one... the dark shall not take.</entry>
